QUEST_20150317_000663	Flurry... turned into a handful of ashes by illuminating a great light. {nl}Did that demon do something? {nl}I had no idea, even as a wizard apprentice.

QUEST_20150317_000672	The Pedigree of Magie
QUEST_20150317_000673	Magie, at the beginning, began from the investigation of mana {nl}and the review of basic elements.

QUEST_20150317_000675	The research twisted previous notions of time and space, {nl}which were beyond the changes of the body, {nl}and the rules of physics and the elements progressed significantly.
QUEST_20150317_000676	The Report of the High Barrier Magie
QUEST_20150317_000677	The barrier in this tower could not have possibly been created by the Demon Lord alone.
QUEST_20150317_000678	It acts like a tight-knit net. {nl}Someone with a normal level of divine power cannot escape from it.
QUEST_20150317_000679	For what reason was this barrier created?{nl}Is it related to the fact that the goddess who controls the flames of this world is staying here?
QUEST_20150317_000680	Agailla Flurry called Gabija to this tower, so this barrier is not meant to lock Gabija in. {nl}To find out the reason for this, we first have to understand the composition of the barrier.
QUEST_20150317_000681	After a long investigation, we've found that this barrier was {nl}not only created with the power of Helgasercle, but rather blended with mana of different wavelengths.
QUEST_20150317_000682	We've also found that mana was composed by aligning the foundation stones in a certain position.
QUEST_20150317_000683	We were able to retrieve some of those foundation stones from various areas in the kingdom. {nl}The new information that we learned from them was astonishing.
QUEST_20150317_000684	The mana provided to use barrier magic wasn't voluntary. {nl}We theorize that the levels of the Demon Lords were divided and sealed into the foundation stones and aligned into a position.
QUEST_20150317_000685	The key to unlock this barrier is in the foundation. {nl}We'll continue to search for the answer after we block Helgasercle's invasion.
QUEST_20150317_000686	The Understanding of Mana
QUEST_20150317_000687	Unlike priests who control the blessing of the goddess directly, {nl}the wizard is defined as a person who releases various magic information or the blessing of the goddess.
QUEST_20150317_000688	Okay so, what is mana? {nl}We can say the true quality of mana is the life force on this land. {nl}The life force of nature. It doesn't just imply the length of lives.
QUEST_20150317_000689	The life force is a form of energy that composes this world and it spreads like branches to various places in the world. {nl}If you could find the source of that energy, you may obtain astonishing power.
QUEST_20150317_000690	The Diary of Antares' Investigation
QUEST_20150317_000691	As I was investigating mana, I discovered one important fact: {nl}The mana which flows steadily in the Mage Tower behaves strangely on the top of the tower
QUEST_20150317_000692	After lengthy research, I found out that there is a third type of energy which is {nl}different from the types of mana we know of, and it has a shape of a specific object.
QUEST_20150317_000693	This object must be from the era of Agailla Flurry as no one knows the existence of this object.
QUEST_20150317_000694	I am sure that this object will bring a new beginning of magic, {nl}but since it is separated at the highest place atop the tower, we have no way to reach it.
QUEST_20150317_000695	We can't demolish the tower nor destroy part of it just to get it.
QUEST_20150317_000696	I will end my writing by stating that this object has more to be investigated.

QUEST_20150317_001079	Revelation of Mage Tower
QUEST_20150317_001080	This is an old story of Fedimian before the Goddess Statue was built.
QUEST_20150317_001081	A long time ago, the people of Fedimian were quite normal, {nl}not much different from the ordinary people of the rest of the world. {nl}However, the people of Fedimian did differ from their worldly peers in one aspect.
QUEST_20150317_001082	The people of Fedimian were very cautious.{nl}In the sense that they take the word 'cautious' much more seriously. {nl}These people were as cautious around fire as they were without.
QUEST_20150317_001083	The Fedimians were modest about this with others. {nl}Even those who stayed at Fedimian for a while could not pick up the trait.
QUEST_20150317_001084	Thanks to this behavior, the people of Fedimian fared better during tough times, {nl}as they were able to sense danger coming.
QUEST_20150317_001085	Because of this, no few words were said about the cautiousness of the Fedimian people.
QUEST_20150317_001086	In Fedimian, if someone dropped money on the ground, it would be gone forever. {nl}In a world where money mostly consists of Silber coins, {nl}only the creditors would know exactly how much money has been lost in this manner.
QUEST_20150317_001087	Why money disappears into the ground at Fedimian remains unknown. {nl}Some people believe the Goddess Zemyna absorbs any money that makes contact with her area. {nl}Most commoners, however, believe this was done to reduce the demand of Silber coins from creditors.
QUEST_20150317_001088	By believing that the goddess herself takes the Silber,{nl}the people found it pointless to try and dig it up in her grounds. {nl}The fact that you can offer Silber coins at Fedimian as tribute to her reinforces this idea.
QUEST_20150317_001089	In any case, the fact that one could lose money by dropping it on Fedimian soil {nl}has made Fedimians very careful in handling their money.
QUEST_20150317_001090	However, as much as one tries to be careful, mistakes still happen. {nl}More so with the case of young girls. {nl}One day, it happened to a girl named Aiste.
QUEST_20150317_001091	Normally, when one drops Silber coins on the ground, it would scatter about on the road, {nl}and then disappear without a trace. {nl}{nl}Fedimians usually curse their own carelessness and move on, {nl}but Aiste was different: she wondered why and how it happened.
QUEST_20150317_001092	To find out what happened, Aiste began inspecting the area she lost her coins at. {nl}In her search she came across a beggar beside the deep end of the canal.
QUEST_20150317_001093	Aiste asked the elderly beggar, {nl}'Did you by any chance pick up the Silber coins I dropped? {nl}{nl}Would you return them to me?{nl}I worked very hard everyday for those coins and really need them.'
QUEST_20150317_001094	The beggar was taken aback. Aiste was asking for the impossible. {nl}After all, finding dropped coins in Fedimian was unthinkable. {nl}The old beggar was about to explain this to Aiste, but instead remarked, {nl}'I've also lost coins in this area. It would be nice if you looked for mine as you searched for yours.'
QUEST_20150317_001095	Almost immediately, the beggar felt guilty of the mocking words he blurted out. He apologized to Aiste.
QUEST_20150317_001096	Why don't you go to where you work and explain what happened to them? Make sure you look lost.' The beggar then hesitantly added, {nl}'In the meantime, I'll be looking for your Silber coins here.'
QUEST_20150317_001097	Upon hearing the beggar's words, Aiste thanked the beggar, and went on to follow his advice. {nl}Through his selfless act, the beggar suddenly felt a revived sense of responsibility. He looked toward the silhouette of the leaving Aiste, his heart heavy and warm from this experience.
QUEST_20150317_001098	Aiste went to the orchards at the outskirts of Fedimian where she worked. {nl}While one could just pick fruit from the trees there, it was also important to take the fruit that fell on the ground.
QUEST_20150317_001099	Smaller hands worked better for picking fruits, so young children were often hired at the orchards. {nl}Some orchards took it a step further: hiring monkeys, whose hands were smaller than that of children, to pick fruit. Monkeys did work more effectively than children, but often ate the fruit they picked. Thus, most owners relied on hiring children.
QUEST_20150317_001100	Returning, Aiste visited the orchard she worked at and explained her situation to the orchard owner. {nl}Unfortunately, the owner was not in a good mood, having just had a quarrel with his wife. {nl}He, like all other Fedimians, knew about the phenomenon, and saw no reason to give Aiste more money.
QUEST_20150317_001101	And so he said, {nl}'Just as you've been able to pick up all my fruit, you should be able to find your lost money at Fedimian, so do not tell me to give you a Sekunde pay.' {nl}The orchard owner's cold words brought tears to the girl's eyes. {nl}The sight broke his heart, but even so, he did not want to give her any more money.
QUEST_20150317_001102	He was soon overtaken by guilt and said, {nl}'If you really need that money, you should go to the silversmith's.'
QUEST_20150317_001103	Aiste set towards the silversmith's place as soon as she heard those words. {nl}Fortunately, the house was located outside Fedimian walls. {nl}Had it been inside, the silversmith ran the risk of losing his money and silverware to the soil.
QUEST_20150317_001104	It is for this reason that he lives on the outskirts of Fedimian. {nl}Aiste knocked on the front door and explained her situation to him as soon as he answered.
QUEST_20150317_001105	The silversmith, after hearing Aiste's story, stated, {nl}'Even for children it is foolish to be so careless. How could you not know that all money that falls on Fedimian soil disappears, never to be found again?'
QUEST_20150317_001106	Aiste was surprised by what the silversmith said and grew sad. {nl}After a while she asked, {nl}'Then why is it that such a cruel thing happens?'
QUEST_20150317_001107	Even the silversmith did not know the true answer, so he improvised, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna must be taking them.'
QUEST_20150317_001108	Hearing those words, Aiste replied, {nl}'Then I will just have to go ask the goddess.' {nl}The silversmith was astounded and replied, {nl}'While you're at it, why don't you ask the goddess to return my silverware?'
QUEST_20150317_001109	The silversmith did not take to heart his own words, but Aiste did. {nl}She immediately set out to do as she said. The silversmith felt sorry for Aiste, {nl}but did not have the courage to call her back as she faded into the distance.
QUEST_20150317_001110	An exhausted Aiste soon arrived at Zemyna's Goddess Statue. {nl}She prostrated herself before it and prayed to the Goddess Statue, her head completely down. {nl}'Oh, Goddess. Please return my lost Silber coins.' {nl}Soon, while offering her prayers, Aiste could no longer hold in her sadness and she finally wept.
QUEST_20150317_001111	How long did she pray crying? {nl}Suddenly, Aiste heard a voice addressed to her. {nl}'My child, have you come to take back what you have lost?'
QUEST_20150317_001112	Aiste knew in her heart that it was Goddess Zemyna that was addressing her. {nl}She stopped crying, cleared her voice and replied so.
QUEST_20150317_001113	The goddess' voice was heard again. {nl}'Aiste, what you're asking of me is not by a method I approve of. Where I reign there is no harvest nor fruits for those who do not work.'
QUEST_20150317_001114	But I worked very hard today!'
QUEST_20150317_001115	I know. So instead, I will give you and the others a chance. Look under your feet.'
QUEST_20150317_001116	The goddess' voice faded with those words, and Aiste found Silber coins under her feet. {nl}She looked to where she had left her silvers and found that the tears she shed had transformed into coins.{nl}Aiste was very happy, and made sure to pick up all the Silber before leaving.
QUEST_20150317_001117	After a number of steps, Aiste thought about the silversmith, {nl}and, again, went to his house and knocked on his door. {nl}As if the silversmith was waiting for her return, he opened the door immediately and said. {nl}'I'm sorry. I regret sending you away like that. I'll give you some Silber. {nl}This time, be careful not to drop any and get home safely.'
QUEST_20150317_001118	As the silversmith held out his Silber coins, Aiste shook her head and said,{nl}'No thank you, the goddess returned all my coins. On top of that, she gave me even more. {nl}I remembered you saying you had also lost Silber, so I came to give you my extra coins. You don't need to give me yours.'
QUEST_20150317_001119	At first, the silversmith was skeptical about the coins being returned, {nl}so he was surprised when Aiste showed him genuine coins. After thinking for a while, the silversmith said, {nl}'Then how about this. You give me what you want while you accept what I was about to give you. {nl}Isn't that fair? On top of that I'll give you a pouch to carry your extra Silber.'
QUEST_20150317_001120	Aiste obliged and gave her extra coins to the silversmith. {nl}After this, the silversmith gave Aiste a bag of coins.
QUEST_20150317_001121	After leaving the silversmith's house, {nl}Aiste suddenly remembered that the old beggar must still be looking for her lost coins and worried for him. {nl}On her way to the beggar, she met the orchard owner again. {nl}Upon seeing Aiste, the orchard owner was overjoyed. {nl}'I was looking for you. I'm sorry for sending you off earlier. As an apology, I'll give you your salary again. {nl}Please be careful not to lose it this time.'
QUEST_20150317_001122	The orchard owner took out a Groß amount of coins, more than what Aiste's salary was, and handed it to her. {nl}However, Aiste shook her head and said, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna already returned my money to me. The silversmith also helped me, so now I actually have too much. {nl}Here, take a look.'
QUEST_20150317_001123	Saying that, Aiste opened the bag of coins she got from the silversmith and showed the orchard owner. {nl}The orchard owner was extremely surprised, as the amount of money she got from the goddess and the silversmith surpassed the amount he had.
QUEST_20150317_001124	Disregarding the amount Aiste had shown him, the orchard owner said, {nl}'Well, even so, I would be ashamed for not giving you my due, so please just take it.' {nl}After saying this, the orchard owner stuffed his coins into Aiste's bag and left. {nl}By the time Aiste could muster up the energy to call the orchard owner, he was too far away.
QUEST_20150317_001125	She hesitated for a moment but then set her mind on the beggar. {nl}After a bit of walking, Aiste arrived at where they met. The old beggar spotted her first and hurried over to her. {nl}He showed her the Silber coins he was clenching onto and said, 'Look! I found your lost Silber.' {nl}Aiste received the beggar's Silber and then showed the beggar her bag and said, {nl}'Look, I found your Silber coins too.'
QUEST_20150317_001126	Even though the beggar was exhausted, he cupped his hands to get his coins back. {nl}Seeing this, Aiste was brought to the brink of tears. {nl}She wondered how much begging the beggar had to do to give her her coins back. {nl}With a heavy heart, Aiste gave the old beggar the coins.
QUEST_20150317_001127	After that, Aiste also held out her bag and said, {nl}'This is a gift as thanks for looking for my Silber. I was given this through Goddess Zemyna's grace.' {nl}Aiste then left before the Old Beggar could figure out how to reply.
QUEST_20150317_001128	The beggar looked towards Aiste's distant shadow, and opened the present she gave him, {nl}curious to what was inside. Inside, he was surprised to find dozens of Silber coins. {nl}Now he understood why Aiste was able to depart much more quickly than she arrived - she had lightened her load by giving him the excess.
QUEST_20150317_001129	For a beggar who had been stingy over a single Silber coin, the fact Aiste could simply give away several tens of times that amount moved him. {nl}The fact that Aiste, who had went off and solved the mystery of Fedimian, came back and gave him what she really didn't owe, made the beggar thankful.
QUEST_20150317_001130	The more he thought, the less the beggar was able to hold back his tears. {nl}As he cried, he noticed something odd - every shining teardrop that touched the ground transformed to Silber coins.
QUEST_20150317_001131	The beggar could not believe his eyes, but quickly remembered Aiste words about a blessing from the goddess. {nl}After a while, the beggar stopped crying, and went to pick up the coins and put them in the bag Aiste gave him.
QUEST_20150317_001132	A few days later, the beggar went to the statue that Aiste prayed to. There, he took out one coin from the bag to keep, and offered the rest to the Goddess Statue. {nl}He then prayed to the goddess whole-heartedly and left. As the money he offered disappeared, the beggar again to shed tears, but that's another story.
QUEST_20150317_001133	After a few days, an odd rumor spread across Fedimian. {nl}The rumor claimed that Silber no longer disappeared into Fedimian soil. {nl}The rumor did not sit well at first with older, experienced people, but some tested the rumor with a paltry amount of Silber, {nl}and it turned out to be true. Everyone agreed that finally, the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian has come to an end.
QUEST_20150317_001134	After some time, word of this occurrence reached the king. Curious as to why this happened, the king ordered an investigation. {nl}The hidden truth was brought to light, and Aiste's story was known.
QUEST_20150317_001135	The king praised the people that caused the miracle with their charitable hearts. {nl}Additionally, to honor the grace of the goddess, he decided to spend the national treasury to build a Groß statue dedicated to her.
QUEST_20150317_001136	On the day the statue was finally completed, {nl}something miraculous happened as the King and Aiste went together to make the first offering. {nl}From the circumference of the statue sprouted coins - all the Silber coins that had been lost by Fedimians up until that time.
QUEST_20150317_001137	After heated debate, the Fedimian people decided to not to hoard their lost Silber coins. {nl}Instead, they asked the king to collect all the coins and distribute them among the poor of the Kingdom. {nl}The king readily agreed, and gave the order to record this beautiful event into the history of the Kingdom.
QUEST_20150317_001138	Even now, nobody knows when and how the mysterious phenomenon of Fedimian started, {nl}but everybody knows when, how, and who helped unravel the mystery. {nl}It was through the kindness of Aiste and the people who helped her, as well as through the grace of the goddess, that the mystery came to an end.
QUEST_20150317_001139	The Gambler of Klaipeda
QUEST_20150317_001140	The Gambler of Klaipeda {nl}~A Short Story~
QUEST_20150317_001141	{nl}{nl}In the town of Klaipeda, there once lived a man by the name of Modestas. {nl}He was a good, honest man - but had one major flaw that his friends and family all worried about, his wife especially so. {nl}Modestas was not lazy nor very clever nor not too foolish. {nl}He did not drink or repeatedly get into fights. {nl}The man had one flaw, and it was that he loved to gamble.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001142	During the day, Modestas would work hard and would never let himself go hungry - {nl}but whenever he earned more than he really needed, he would gamble. {nl}The wife would always try to save this money, but not one extra coin would ever go toward their home.
QUEST_20150317_001143	Whenever she could, Modestas' wife would often go to the shrine, and pray to the goddess' likeness. {nl}But Modestas continued his odd habits, and the people around him grew increasingly concerned. {nl}After all, the mind of a gambler would think, 'Today it may be small, but tomorrow it could be big!' {nl}And so the days rolled by, same as they ever were, until one peculiar day.
QUEST_20150317_001144	Like most of his days, Modestas was heading home after gambling away his excess coins. {nl}He was walking through the Siauliai Woods on the path to Klaipeda, when he saw a strange, old woman on the road.
QUEST_20150317_001145	This old woman seemed not only old and frail, but had an unnerving aura around her. {nl}She was acting strangely, as if deep in thought or as if she was obsessed with whatever she was doing. {nl}Modestas thought about simply ignoring the woman and walking past. Nothing would have happened if he did that, {nl}but curiosity got the better of him.
QUEST_20150317_001146	To be precise, what really turned his head toward the old woman was what she held in her hands. {nl}Gold. The woman seemed to be obsessing over two gold pieces, doing something with them. {nl}Unable to hear her mumbling, Modestas drew closer to the strange woman.
QUEST_20150317_001147	Over the jingling sound of gold, the old woman muttered. {nl}'If these two pieces of gold could ever marry, the baby gold would make me rich... but there's no life in these things...' {nl}Modestas heard those words, and decided to comment. {nl}'That gold won't make you rich by itself, so just put it into something worthwhile. {nl}Do you really think muttering at gold will do something?'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001148	The old woman spoke plainly, 'Why not? If it works, this'll certainly be the most pleasant, risk-free way to wealth.' {nl}'That's ridiculous. You should do what I do and gamble.' {nl}The woman was incensed.
QUEST_20150317_001149	'So, you think your betting ways are better?' {nl}'Why wouldn't I? There are moments where I could win or lose, but your way won't make any gold at all.' {nl}With Modestas' words, the old woman paused in thought. Finally, she said, {nl}'Then let's have a bet.'
QUEST_20150317_001150	The disturbing aura around her grew as soon as the offer reached Modestas' ears. He couldn't outright refuse. {nl}'What kind of bet?' {nl}'We'll see whether your way or my way will make us richer.' {nl}'And if I lose?'
QUEST_20150317_001151	'Don't worry about that. You will win, and you will lose - that won't change. The rules are fixed.' {nl}'What do you mean by that?' {nl}'By taking my offer, you will fail once, and you will win once. No matter what happens.' {nl}'Well, yeah. Winning and losing is how gambling works.'
QUEST_20150317_001152	'No. No matter how unlucky things may seem, you will win your first gamble. {nl}And then, no matter how favorable life may seem, you will fail the next.'
QUEST_20150317_001153	Modestas was still confused by these strange words. {nl}'So, you're saying I'll win on every odd bet, and lose on every even one?' {nl}'Yes. It will be so. You will win some, and then you won't. Is that not fair? {nl}One coin will be enough to succeed, no matter how many bets you make. That is my offer.' {nl}'You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001154	With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}'Three times each should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}Naturally, if you don't have more coin after your sixth bet, I will win.'
QUEST_20150317_001155	Modestas seemed to tremble. 'How much should I earn, then?' {nl}'You'll start with one gold piece,' she replied, 'and when you return, show me all your gold pieces but that one. {nl}If you stretch that single piece to anything more, then you win. As for time... you have one week.' {nl}'So, what do you get when I lose?' Modestas reminded her.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001156	'Well...' the old woman lingered, 'If you win, everyone will know about my gold - {nl}and you'll have the power of winning and losing. On the other hand...' {nl}''On the other hand...'?' Modestas said, tensely.
QUEST_20150317_001157	'After I win, the friends you know will disappear every time you lose a bet.' {nl}Modestas was unnerved by the conditions set. He did not immediately object; instead, he thought of victory, {nl}and soon accepted. Modestas was, most of all, the kind of person who never backed down.
QUEST_20150317_001158	As Modestas and the old woman parted ways, he, in any case, knew he now had a dangerous power guaranteeing his victory at any time in the near future. {nl}He walked, looking for the next person to bet huge on. As he wondered how much to wager on his next move, he heard the sound of galloping behind him.
QUEST_20150317_001159	Modestas turned around. It was his good old friend, Sigfried, riding on horseback towards him. {nl}They knew each other well, as both had been together through the highs and lows of gambling. They exchanged greetings and talked about where they were going. Sigfried dismounted to walk at a leisurely pace with his friend, idly chatting along their way. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001160	However, before long, Modestas could no longer continue walking with Sigfried. {nl}He was fully aware of his deadline, and had no time for such trivial activities. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001161	Even during their normal everyday conversations, Modestas and Sigfried unconsciously made big and small bets. Eventually, one would utter the word, 'Bet?' unconsciously. {nl}Neither of them were rich so these bets weren't ever that significant. Knowing this would trigger the curse, Modestas really wanted to ask Sigfried to leave. {nl}In the end, Modestas uttered these words: {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001162	'Are you not busy? You seemed to be in a hurry on your horse before you passed by for a talk. You should stop worrying about me and go.' {nl}Sigfried, hearing Modestas' words, replied, {nl} 'I was busy, but I still have time to walk with you for another ten minutes or so. This horse might not look like much, but when it comes down to it, he can go pretty fast.' {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001163	Seeing Sigfried not budge, Modestas tried again to persuade him, {nl}'Wouldn't it be better to be early as opposed to be on time?' {nl}{nl}Hearing this, Sigfried became adamant, {nl}'Do you not believe what I just said, or are you willfully ignoring it all?' {nl}A disconcerted Modestas said, {nl}'No, I didn't mean it like that...' {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001164	However, before Modestas could say any more, Sigfried said, 'If you don't believe me, why don't we have a bet?' {nl}{nl}Naturally, the words, 'Sure. What do you want to wager?' rose up in Modestas' throat.
QUEST_20150317_001165	Considering Modestas' habit, to not immediately accept a gamble took superhuman willpower from him. {nl}'What... What kind of bet?' {nl}'We're going to bet on whether my horse is fast or not.' {nl}Modestas desperately fought against his inner gambler.
QUEST_20150317_001166	On the other hand, Sigfried was understandably confident, knowing with certainty that he would win the gamble, and was alright with betting his horse. {nl}With only a little money at hand, the bet became too good to refuse, and Modestas finally accepted. {nl}And, as expected, Modestas won. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001167	As soon as the bet started, Sigfried tried every method possible to command his horse to move. Despite his efforts, it didn't move a single hoof at all.{nl}At the end, Sigfried repeatedly cursed its strange behavior. Realizing he'd be late to his appointment without a horse, he threw the reins to Modestas and sprinted away.{nl}As Sigfried disappeared, Modestas felt uncomfortable.
QUEST_20150317_001168	For Modestas, who had always been elated upon winning bets and depressed upon losing them, to win and feel depressed was a first in his entire life. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001169	Knowing he had just deceived his long-time gambling friend, Sigfried, and also missed an opportunity to earn a lot of money, Modestas felt conflicted as he walked slowly alongside the horse he had just won. {nl}While walking, Modestas remembered the earlier warnings of his unconditional bet. He realized that now, with his upcoming defeat, he was doomed to not earn any more Silber than he started with.
QUEST_20150317_001170	While walking along the road, Modestas encountered a group of soldiers. {nl}Upon looking closer, the soldiers seemed to be arguing about what to buy at a store. {nl}Modestas decided not to interfere and pass them, but the soldiers noticed him and called. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001171	'You, the young man with the horse, can you come over and help us for a bit?' {nl}Modestas had no idea what these soldiers needed help for, but since he could no longer ignore them, he decided to head over. {nl}Once Modestas arrived, one of the soldiers said, {nl}'You came at just the right time. We would like you to referee a small gamble we're about to make here.' {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001172	Modestas was surprised when he heard the word, 'gamble', but was relieved to know he was only being asked to referee. After all, nothing could possibly happen if he was just refereeing. {nl}Modestas learned that the soldiers were fighting over which goddess was the best. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001173	What started as trivial banter turned into a big argument, which finally grew to become a big money bet. The soldiers had already gathered their money and only had to decide the winner. Unfortunately, every goddess got equal votes and a winner couldn't be decided.{nl}Thus, the soldiers decided to settle the bet by calling the first person who passed by, asking him who he thought the best goddess is, and deciding the winner from there. The soldiers agreed that the first passer-by would symbolize the will of whatever goddess he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001174	The soldiers did not tell Modestas who voted for which goddess, for fear of his decision being affected by the expressions of each individual soldier. {nl}The soldiers did tell him however, how much they have each wagered. Just by seeing the gold nuggets, he could easily figure that there was a Groß amount of money in this bet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001175	Since a big jackpot was on the line, the soldiers waited with bated breath for Modestas' answer. {nl}Knowing there was no right answer to the question, Modestas simply said aloud the name of his own favorite goddess. {nl}When he did, the soldiers reacted strangely. {nl}There was supposed to be an ecstatic winner and disappointed losers, but nobody seemed joyful nor disappointed. Instead, everyone had a bewildered look on their faces. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001176	Modestas, perplexed by their reaction, asked for an explanation to which one of the soldiers answered, {nl}'We originally had votes for four goddesses but your choice isn't any of them, so now we have five goddesses.' {nl}The soldiers then resumed their squabble about how to decide the winner. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001177	The mood began to deteriorate so Modestas wanted to leave. {nl}When he was about to take off, the soldiers blocked his path and accused him. {nl}'It's your fault the argument heated up even more. You're not thinking of just leaving are you?'{nl}Intimidated by the irritated soldiers, Modestas dared not to escape. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001178	In Modestas' mind, he concluded that the quarrelling soldiers didn't have him referee, but simply added him into the bet. In reality however, he had no real claim, so he wasn't in the bet just yet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001179	Knowing Modestas, he could not simply sit on the sidelines watching a big bet grow. Eventually, he became enticed to join. Modestas, caught in the heat of the moment and ending up participating, finally remembered it was his turn to lose.{nl}But it was too late.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001180	In addition, because the other soldiers had already bet deeply, Modestas had to bet the only gold bullion he had. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001181	If you think about it, even if it was not his turn to lose, all it took for him do so was one more vote for any of the goddesses he didn't choose. With the odds of the next person walking by supporting his goddess being against him, the probability of winning was low anyway.{nl}{nl}However, the victor was chosen unexpectedly. An officer found the soldiers slacking, disciplined them and was about to lead them away. {nl}The soldiers, obeying the superior's command, were about to march off when they shrewdly asked him which goddess he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001182	The officer inadvertently said the name of a goddess, and some of the soldiers began cheering. {nl}The officer, not knowing what was going on, simply ordered his soldiers to move along. In any case, Modestas certainly lost. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001183	Having now lost the gold bullion given to him by the strange old woman, Modestas was now at a loss. {nl}To originally intend to referee, only to end up losing all the gold he had, all while knowing exactly the reason why... Modestas felt heartbroken, dumbfounded, and yet, understanding. A unique feeling. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001184	Although Modestas had just lost money by entering a bet started by others, it was the first time he'd done so in his life. Modestas spent some time thinking of how to better his situation and {nl}suddenly got an idea, knowing he was certain to win his next bet. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001185	If he could call back the soldiers from earlier and bet his horse, he could certainly earn his gold back and possibly more. {nl}Knowing this, Modestas got on his horse, and sped in the direction the soldiers left towards. {nl}{nl}With speed, Modestas soon spotted a stationary wagon. Modestas lowered his speed to check out the wagon parked on the side of the road. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001186	Unfortunately, just as Modestas pulled up at the wagon, his horse suddenly grew agitated, forcing him off. Fortunately, because he had cut his speed and fell on muddy ground, he was not greatly injured. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001187	Someone approached Modestas who had been lying down, hurt, and helped him get back on his feet. He turned out to be one of the people standing on the side, the wagon owner. {nl}The man who helped Modestas uttered with relief, {nl}'I am glad you're not too hurt. Your horse also didn't hurt himself tripping over that pit.'{nl}Modestas noticed a well-hidden pit where he pointed. {nl}The wagon owner continued.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001188	'My horse became injured here and can no longer pull my wagon. It's just an empty wagon, but at any rate, it won't be going anywhere for a while. That's why I have a proposition. Won't you sell me your horse? I believe, with a healthy horse pulling the wagon, even my injured horse can help pull it in some way.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001189	It was an unexpected suggestion, but Modestas needed the horse to quickly find and catch up to the soldiers. He immediately refused the offer.{nl}The wagon owner tried to explain there was no way his injured horse can pull the wagon alone, but Modestas was not persuaded. After his repeated refusal, the wagon owner offered a new suggestion.{nl}'Then let's do this. What if you buy my wagon? I will sell it for cheap. Since my injured horse can't pull the wagon, it will be better off in your hands.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001190	Modestas could see that the wagon was very durable, good-looking and has been well cared for. However, he had no immediate need for a wagon, so he hesitated. {nl}In addition, Modestas had no money now; no matter how low the wagon owner went, he did not have the money to buy it. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001191	The human heart sure can be an amusing thing. {nl}Modestas, deciding the wagon was worth buying but lacking the money to do so, decided he could use his impending victory to win the wagon for free. {nl}So he proposed a bet with the wagon master, risking his own horse. {nl}Naturally, Modestas won. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001192	Modestas, having now just won a wagon and an injured horse, originally intended to keep just the wagon and his original horse. {nl}But seeing as the injured horse wasn't as injured as he thought, he believed he had won big. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001193	In his mind, now that he'd had obtained two horses and a wagon, he believed he was no longer in a bad situation, deciding this time to be very careful not to lose big next. {nl}So, instead of following the soldiers, he decided to go to a place where there was less people. He reined his horse and traveled away from civilization. {nl}However, even in a remote setting, he was bound to meet others. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001194	Rare as it would be, Modestas, while moving about in a uninhabited mountain, encountered an elderly Alchemist. {nl}The old Alchemist sat on a chair on the right side of the road, a Silber nugget in hand. {nl}As Modestas passed by for a closer look, the nugget turned out to not be of Silber, but of lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001195	'Could this Alchemist be one who could turn lead into gold?' thought Modestas, but soon thought he was just overestimating the Alchemist. {nl}But the Alchemist, glad to see someone pass by after a long time, called out to Modestas, and suddenly proposed a bet with him. Somehow, the whole world today seemed to want to make bets with Modestas, and he was getting tired of it. {nl}Modestas liked gambling, but to find opponents this easily was becoming a joke to him. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001196	Modestas was about to do something unlike his being and reject the bet, but the idea that he could wager low moved his mind. {nl}After all, the old Alchemist was wagering a lead nugget. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001197	Because he was certain to lose this time, Modestas believed it would be better to wager and lose against a lead nugget now than to run into people who would wager a Groß amount of money, and lose later. {nl}Modestas first made sure that he could accept the bet despite having no money at hand and could bring some later, and accepted the bet. No words need to be said about the result. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001199	However, right as the bet was settled, the lead nugget prize let out a sparkle and, in a moment, clearly became gold. {nl}The Old Alchemist now snickered, 'Now you owe me one gold nugget. Be sure to bring it.' {nl}Modestas protested, but as much as he looked, what the old Alchemist now held was clearly no longer lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001200	Instead, it was clearly gold, so in the end Modestas had bet and lost against a gold nugget. {nl}A now-tired Modestas ultimately had no way of objecting to the Alchemist. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001201	Now, Modestas had lost more gold than he owed the strange old woman. {nl}And now, he only had one unconditional victory and defeat left. {nl}As Modestas lead his wagon through the rest of the mountain path, he murmured about having to make sure his next win was a very big one. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001202	'This time, no matter what, I have to wage a bet against the world's richest - well maybe not the richest - but a wealthy man at the least.'{nl}As soon as he uttered these words, his surroundings shook like an earthquake and a heavy, deep voice declared.{nl}'I am the richest in this region.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001203	Modestas scanned his surroundings but failed to find anyone. So he asked,{nl}'Who are you?'{nl}The deep, heavy voice answered his question.{nl}'I am where you stand. In your tongue, I am called the mountain.'{nl}Modestas, in disbelief, couldn't help but talk back.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001204	You are... the mountain?'{nl}'That is correct. I am the mountain, and just as you are looking for, the richest around here.'{nl}'You are the mountain? Well, no, even if you are the mountain, how can you claim to be the richest?'{nl}'I own much land, for my sierra stretches far. Further in me, I contain Groß, valuable lodes.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001205	Hearing about the mountain's valuable lodes revived Modestas' habit. He even knew that this time, he was certain to win. Modestas started persuading the self-proclaiming mountain to make a bet with him. The mountain, unconcerned over winning or losing this bet, agreed. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001206	For a person to have a fateful encounter with a mysterious being like this, even Modestas doubted his own sanity. {nl}In any case, Modestas bet against the mountain's ores, and won.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001207	At the end of the bet, the mountain erupted, and a Groß boulder landed directly in front of Modestas. It was certainly something, but the boulder didn't seem to be what Modestas expected. For the mountain, this was the gambling debt repaid. {nl}In Modestas' eyes however, there should have been veins of gold, or at least something useful, like copper or coal. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001208	Even if the mountain's veins contained nothing but rocks, he thought he could end up owning a Groß quarry to dig out valuable stones. Instead, the mountain had paid an inadequate reward.{nl}When Modestas pointed it out, the mountain disagreed. {nl}'All you own are two horses and a wagon.'
QUEST_20150317_001209	'Surely one must wage things of equal value. This boulder is worth as much as you own.'{nl}With that said, the mountain returned to its former self, never to deal with Modestas nor anyone else ever again. {nl}Modestas, in his desperate situation, had wasted his crucial chance just to win one big boulder.{nl}Despite his bad luck, he consoled himself by knowing at least he had horses and a wagon to transport the boulder.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001210	And then suddenly, anxiety struck him. He realized that, although he has an unconditional loss upcoming, given the strange things that happened up to now, he would not be able to easily control the outcome of the final bet. {nl}Nonetheless, Modestas knew he couldn't stay where he was right now, and decided to leave. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001211	Modestas got up and tried to move the boulder, but to no avail. It was simply too Groß for him to handle by himself. {nl}He considered leaving it behind, but after recalling the mountain's saying that the boulder was worth more than his two horses and wagon combined, he believed that would be a waste. {nl}Supposing he could sell the boulder to a local quarry for a good amount of money, he became troubled and unable to leave. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001212	In front of Modestas, who had been worrying, appeared a familiar figure. It was none other than the one who had started the bet - the suspicious old woman.{nl}The old woman questioned Modestas.{nl}'How is it? Is it going well?'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001213	Modestas confessed he was far from making profits; instead he was in debt, wasted all his chances to win, and only had his last, losing bet remaining.{nl}After listening to his story the old woman responded flatly, {nl}'Since you only have one bet left, go ahead and make your last losing bet. Then all that's left for you to do is pay up your end of the bargain for losing the bet against me.'{nl}Modestas was a man who loved to gamble, but he was not the type to throw a tantrum, nor was he a sore loser.
QUEST_20150317_001214	Modestas knew these gambles were more than just about money. {nl}Modestas, a dedicated gambler, nodded along with the woman's words. He clearly looked to be a man with a huge burden, his facial expression dark. {nl}The old woman could sense Modestas' thoughts, so she made this proposal. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001215	'Since you are unsure how to transport this boulder you suddenly won, how about this? Normally, I wouldn't change the initial conditions, but for my amusement I will give you a suggestion. Why don't you use your last bet to see whether or not I can lift this boulder up into your wagon? Even if you lose, at least you can have this heavy boulder loaded on your wagon.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001216	Modestas who had nothing to lose, nodded his head to accept her proposal. But before he could consent to the bet, the old woman continued. {nl}'But I can't just give you such a favorable idea for free. Therefore I will add one more condition.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001217	When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful, then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance since you've already lost the bet. How about it?'{nl}Like always, Modestas had no choice.
QUEST_20150317_001218	The moment Modestas agreed to the proposal, the old woman pointed her finger past him. {nl}Modestas turned around and to his surprise, the boulder he had trouble with was effortlessly placed on the wagon. By the time Modestas looked forward again, the old woman had already disappeared. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001219	Because Modestas had no ropes or equipment to secure the boulder onto the wagon, he had to lean the wagon and carefully drive it to Klaipeda. {nl}On his way to Klaipeda, he again met the soldiers who he had earlier bet against. Their commanding officer was now aware of what had happened thus far, and wanted to apologize to Modestas for getting him caught up and hurt in his subordinates' affairs. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001220	The officer returned Modesta's gold to him, and ordered his soldiers to help him transport the boulder back to Klaipeda. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001221	The officer and solders had sturdy rope, so they were able to transport the rock without worry of it falling off and unload it at Klaipeda. They decided to accompany Modestas all the way there. {nl}Modestas was very grateful for the help. {nl} Along with the soldiers, Modestas again ran into none other than the Alchemist he had lost earlier against.
QUEST_20150317_001222	To Modestas, a promise was a promise, so he immediately handed over the gold the soldiers returned to him to the Alchemist. {nl}The Alchemist, surprised by how Modestas could do this with no complaints or dissatisfaction, took the gold and conversed with him.
QUEST_20150317_001223	Not wanting to be left out of the conversation between Modestas and the Alchemist, the soldiers couldn't continue working, joined in, and learned about the Alchemist's past with Modestas. {nl}The Alchemist apologized to Modestas for turning his lead into gold, and promised to gather all the support he could for Modestas at Klaipeda. He then left. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001224	Soon after, Modestas and the soldiers reached Klaipeda. They set the stone down at the Groß open space at the center of town. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001225	When the boulder was set in its proper place with the help of the soldiers, the Alchemist who had left returned with another person. The Alchemist had brought with him a famous Dievdirbys.{nl}To the Dievdirbys, the Alchemist suggested, {nl}'Why don't you sculpt a statue of a goddess using this boulder, on this central site of Klaipeda? If this boulder is changed into a statue of a goddess, then nobody in Klaipeda will be able to deny its significance. I think that will fulfill your promise to the old woman.'{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001226	Everyone who was there favored the idea on the spot. {nl}The Alchemist took the gold he obtained from Modestas and paid it to the Dievdirbys as commission, and went to get permission from the Knight Commander and Bishop of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001227	As news spread, everyone in Klaipeda was pleased to know a Goddess Statue was planned for their city. {nl}However, one last problem remained, asides from winning their favor. And that question was, which goddess should the statue commemorate? {nl}The soldiers who gave help transporting the boulder were especially passionate about this issue, and began quarrelling again. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001228	The one who answered this question was none other than Modestas. {nl}Without any real intent, Modestas argued that the goddesses in power have guided him via divine providence to build a statue at Klaipeda that day. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001229	That the old woman appeared before him, that the many bets occurred, that the mountain erupted a stone for material was the divine providence of the goddesses, argued Modestas, persuading everyone. {nl}Thus, the people decided to follow the words of Modestas, and Modestas relayed to the Dievdirbys the order to create the statue. {nl}When the statue was finally finished, the citizens of Klaipeda gathered, curious to know the identity of the goddess who had been raised in the center of their beloved city.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001230	However, to their bewilderment, not a single soul could recognize the goddess whom the completed statue commemorated.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001231	The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}Despite the numerous questions, nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001232	And so, some people believed Modestas, having undertaken the goddesses' intervention, was an honest man who did not gamble. In reality, Modestas didn't stop making gambles until his death. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001233	Ever since then, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing: the answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl} {nl}But no matter the impossible odds, Modestas never lost a bet. Nobody was able to win the answer from Modestas for years, and time flew by.{nl}
QUEST_20150317_001234	Though Modestas died an undefeated, invincible gambler, he had never bet anything other than the goddess' identity, living purely off the profits gained from such bets through the end of his life. {nl}
QUEST_20150317_001235	In the end, this unknown goddess, in exchange for giving a livelihood to a certain gambler from Klaipeda, created an interesting, mysterious, yet beautiful statue for the city of Klaipeda, and a tale to last for times to come.{nl}{nl}

QUEST_20150323_001425	Four scouts were sent to Sirdgela Forest not too long ago but all of them went missing. {nl}Maybe they took the Thorn Forest too lightly... {nl}Please find their whereabouts.
QUEST_20150323_001426	I no longer have the strength to carry on, but will write this for anyone who has made it past this area. {nl}Naktis... it's funny that I yearn for a curse on the Monarch of Curses.
QUEST_20150323_001427	Naktis scattered cursed Tree Root Crystals in the area. {nl}To stop the curse, they must be destroyed.
QUEST_20150323_001428	Perhaps I shall soon lose my breath. {nl}Pilgrims, may the blessings of the goddess be with you!
QUEST_20150323_001429	Please be sure to find the scripture! {nl}One of the pilgrim souls entrapped in here must have it.
QUEST_20150323_001430	All pilgrims should offer different amounts.
QUEST_20150323_001431	This is not a reasonable amount.
QUEST_20150323_001432	Worship the Goddess Statue to receive blessings or move on to another area.
QUEST_20150323_001433	What a nasty curse. {nl}Let's see which is stronger. Naktis' curse or the goddess' purifier.
QUEST_20150323_001434	Of course I have the purifier. {nl}But I'm not giving it to you unless you offer me money.
QUEST_20150323_001435	It could be the one who stole the gypsum carving of the Goddess Statue, so get rid of the monsters there. {nl}If my hunch is right, then Naktis must be behind it. {nl} It might be far away, but I just heard that.
QUEST_20150323_001436	Naktis is looking for a clue to enter the Cathedral. {nl}If I'm right, not only has the Forest of Prayer been affected, but all of the Pilgrim's Way. {nl}Revelator, if you reach the Cathedral, please defeat Naktis. {nl}You must stop the goddess' revelation from falling into demon hands.
QUEST_20150323_001437	This place is dying. {nl}All the Tree Root Crystals have mutated.
QUEST_20150323_001438	Some Tree Root Crystals are useless unless burned. {nl}Some even fume at the core.

QUEST_20150323_001440	I feel like I'm drowning. {nl}The Tree Root Crystal is slowly killing me.
QUEST_20150323_001441	Do whatever it takes to destroy it... {nl}Please help.
QUEST_20150323_001442	I've lost all desire. Am I dying now? {nl}Eating and even breathing feels meaningless.
QUEST_20150323_001443	But it must go on. {nl}Unless that cursed Tree Root Crystal is destroyed...
QUEST_20150323_001444	There are things that Witas cares about. {nl}Won't he get his mind back if you show him those? 
QUEST_20150323_001445	Somebody's Diary
QUEST_20150323_001446	Those brothers are crazy. They must be completely nuts. {nl}When did it start? When Dora attacked Gracius? {nl}When they saw the demons marching?
QUEST_20150323_001447	Things have gone to hell since Gracius was incapacitated. {nl}From the very beginning, while I kept my mouth shut, everyone lusted for bloodshed. {nl}The town was like a volcano waiting to erupt. {nl}I thought it was an educational experience until then.
QUEST_20150323_001448	Then something snapped. {n1}A fellow clergyman, I can't remember who, had murdered Dion in his sleep with a mace and I... {nl}Everyone... {nl}No one could remember why they wanted to become a priest anymore.
QUEST_20150323_001449	This surely is not a teaching of Sir Maven. {nl}Greed? Laziness? How can we call killing one another, 'teaching a lesson'? {nl}I even envy Dion for dying first.
QUEST_20150323_001450	I can hear snickering somewhere. {nl}It could be the sound of Dora deceiving me. {nl}It doesn't really matter any more.
QUEST_20150323_001451	The trapped spirit gave you a scripture and disappeared.
QUEST_20150323_001452	You endured Witas' curse thanks to the medicine.
QUEST_20150323_001453	If you ever see the Devout Tree, please bring it back to life. {nl}I've heard that tree can block the power of the curse.
QUEST_20150323_001454	I believe that the evil will eventually fall and the goddess will be victorious. {nl}The mark of victory is right in front of me.
QUEST_20150323_001455	Anyway, I will go to the battlegrounds first, so please help the Watchers and my followers. {nl}I will see you at Nefritas Cliff.

QUEST_20150323_001464	It should be destroyed before the curse spreads. {nl}However, I cannot handle the Tree Root Crystals alone. 
QUEST_20150323_001465	Souls of Pilgrims swallowed by the monsters can destroy the Tree Root Crystal. {nl}Maybe I, too, will be one of them soon.

QUEST_20150323_001504	Farming alone keeps me busy.
QUEST_20150323_001505	I'm not sure yet... about that... rebellion.
QUEST_20150323_001506	It's enticing, but...
QUEST_20150323_001507	Do you have a written letter of Horacius? 
QUEST_20150323_001508	No wonder! Here you go.

QUEST_20150323_001516	I'll actively cooperate.
QUEST_20150323_001517	Our rebellion will be successful. We can't be exploited like this any more.
QUEST_20150323_001518	Ah, really? Then I should give.
QUEST_20150323_001519	The exploitation became too much at some point... There's no generosity any more.
QUEST_20150323_001520	Then give us some Silber.
QUEST_20150323_001521	Here you go. Use it well. Everyone, cheer up!
QUEST_20150323_001522	What do you want?
QUEST_20150323_001523	Someone's even more pathetic than me...
QUEST_20150323_001524	Beats me. I'll just give it to you.
QUEST_20150323_001525	What are they talking about? The baron is hiding something...?
QUEST_20150323_001526	There is no such thing as a rest day for a farmer. 
QUEST_20150323_001527	I'm busy. Come back later.
QUEST_20150323_001528	Don't bother me.
QUEST_20150323_001529	Then, I will sign the petition if you pay 10,000 Silber.
QUEST_20150323_001530	I've never met anyone as generous as you! So kind! Hahaha! Take this!
QUEST_20150323_001531	What a penniless bum. Go away.
QUEST_20150323_001532	That's some persistence you've got. Fine. I don't really trust you but I'll sign for Horacius' sake.

QUEST_20150323_001546	I'm very busy right now so come back later.
QUEST_20150323_001547	My signature for the petition? You think I'd just give it to you? No. At least pay me for it or something...
QUEST_20150323_001548	Aha, now we're talking. Let me sign that. For the rebellion!
QUEST_20150323_001549	Is this a joke...
QUEST_20150323_001550	What kind of big plan could a bum come up with?
QUEST_20150323_001551	You've got some persistence. Here's my signature. 
QUEST_20150323_001552	I can't just take a break from farming. I'm busy right now.
QUEST_20150323_001553	Do you have around 15,000 Silber? Show some sincerity...

QUEST_20150323_001558	Come back later. I'm resting.
QUEST_20150323_001559	The plan of Horacius? You must be talking about that thing. I knew this day would come. I'll definitely give you my signature. 
QUEST_20150323_001560	I am just waiting for the day of the rebellion.
QUEST_20150323_001561	I don't even have enough money for my sick family... I don't care about the rebellion!
QUEST_20150323_001562	Oh my, thank you! I'll definitely be joining the rebellion. 
QUEST_20150323_001563	Someone, somewhere, is gulping down food while I don't even have money to feed my family... 
QUEST_20150323_001564	You and I are both poor. We can't think of anything else while we're starving.

QUEST_20150323_001582	Keep your guard up. {nl}This may be the secret to the last key, but the demons are still watching.
QUEST_20150323_001583	You will enter a special room once you get all five keys of Maven. {nl}In there, you will be tested to see if you're eligible for the revelation.
QUEST_20150323_001584	The number of candles is important. But for this secret, you must remember the order of the candles as well. {nl}It is similar to the first secret.

QUEST_20150323_001604	Gluttony, Wrath, Sloth...{nl}The nature of all curses that affect{nl}mankind is obsession.{nl}It makes the spirits of the dead prefer staying behind as opposed to going to the goddess. 
QUEST_20150323_001605	The difference is that it is the will of the dead that keeps the spirit behind {nl}while curses are forced upon by others onto you.
QUEST_20150323_001606	Naturally, priests learning the teachings of the goddess are not permitted to use it unless it's for experiments.
QUEST_20150323_001607	My Mission 1
QUEST_20150323_001608	Even if the Revelator gets the revelation in his hands, {nl}it's useless if it can't be protected.

QUEST_20150323_001622	It was really dangerous a while ago. {nl}If you were any later, we would never have seen the third key.
QUEST_20150323_001623	If you use the symbol of spirits, you can see the area where spirits will be absorbed. {nl}Besiege the demons there and their evil force will be absorbed into the symbol.
QUEST_20150323_001624	Once the Symbol of Spiritual Power is charged, go to Veinika Altar. {nl}Insert the symbol in the Veinika altar and you will receive the third key of Maven.
QUEST_20150323_001625	The medicine should work.
QUEST_20150323_001626	The key is at Gaule Altar. {nl}I think you should leak that much information to Naktis' servants.
QUEST_20150323_001627	Of course, you'll need to use the transformation scroll before doing so. 
QUEST_20150323_001628	The secret supposedly unveils upon application of a holy force, {nl}but the trap will activate regardless if it detects an evil force.
QUEST_20150323_001629	The plan is to get the key after exhausting that trap using Naktis' servants.
QUEST_20150323_001630	Naktis' servants will be punished for prying on Maven's secret. {nl}Use that opportunity to get the key.
QUEST_20150323_001631	Even if the goddess condemns me for this... I will hold my head high,{nl} because it was for the protection of the revelation.
QUEST_20150323_001632	Did you find the last key?
QUEST_20150323_001633	This sanctuary is a treasure house of knowledge. {nl}You need to master the fundamentals of everything to protect the kingdom,{nl}and the revelation in the name of the goddess.

QUEST_20150323_001635	The monarch of curses, Naktis... {nl}She has not shown herself yet, but I'm sure she's somewhere inside the sanctuary.
QUEST_20150323_001636	Perhaps she's waiting for us to get all the keys.
QUEST_20150323_001637	I am honored to be able to now guide you to the hidden room.
QUEST_20150323_001638	Focus on the colors of the orbs. {nl}You should insert the key in orbs of the same color.
QUEST_20150323_001639	Of course it is impossible to press down both footrests alone. {nl}You can use the wood chunks the demons scattered around... or ask colleagues for help. 
QUEST_20150323_001640	Coincidentally, I heard an eyewitness account from a refugee from this area. {nl}He asked for the safety of his family when I was being sent here... {nl}But I can't see any member of the Greene family, just refugees and monsters. 
QUEST_20150323_001641	And I found this mysterious seedling. {nl}Unlike others, we can feel a mysterious force from these. {nl}I can't identify this force in detail... {nl}But I'm sure it can purify evil.
QUEST_20150323_001642	We would have known better if Master was here. {nl}At any rate, we have to test if this seedling actually has the power to purify. {nl}I will do a simple purifying ritual. {nl}Get me some Ellom Leaves to grasp the pollution status of this area. 
QUEST_20150323_001643	Now, let's start. {nl}Please watch together. 
QUEST_20150323_001644	But he is a druid who has accomplished as much as I have. {nl}I think he can find out what the secret of this seedling is.
QUEST_20150323_001645	Also, you may experience something unusual if you have this twig. {nl}If you do, please tell him about it too.
QUEST_20150323_001646	Please find my colleague in Shaton Farm.
QUEST_20150323_001647	Aren't the dandelions around pretty? {nl}They disservice me, however, by sucking nutrients from the ground. {nl}If this continues, we won't be having a wheat harvest next season. {nl}Please remove the dandelions from the farm. 
QUEST_20150323_001648	Huh?
QUEST_20150323_001649	Huh?
QUEST_20150323_001650	Huh?
QUEST_20150323_001651	Huh? 
QUEST_20150323_001652	We're fighting hard. {nl}My mens' injuries are far more urgent than the farmers, wouldn't you agree? {nl}But some druid provided medicine only to the farmers which they then hid away. {nl}I have no words...
QUEST_20150323_001653	It's simple. I will look out for my men first. {nl}Bring me the medicine that they've hidden. It shouldn't be hard to find. {nl}Probably in some wooden box or grape wagon, possibly an empty house... Somewhere there.
QUEST_20150323_001654	But be careful. {nl}If this bowl fills with water, the spell will fume a special force. {nl}Then the monsters attracted to that force might attack. 
QUEST_20150323_001655	It was successful. {nl}Did you know these seeds are the same type as the mysterious seedlings? {nl}Seems like a wide range of land can be purified if it's grown well enough.
QUEST_20150323_001656	Growing these will use up parts of the cultivated farm however. {nl}The landlord of the farm in the reservoir area, Shaton, {nl}is here just in time so I should try persuading him while I can.
QUEST_20150323_001657	I'll meet you in the reservoir area.

QUEST_20150323_001659	My parent passed away on Medzio Diena because of them. {nl}I applied as a soldier here for my parents' revenge. {nl}But... it's a shame. I can't even so much as look at them. {nl}Please, do me a favor and kill them for me!
QUEST_20150323_001660	They'll jump out when you approach the bush and more'll come out if you shake it. {nl}You're partly responsible for it so you should help.
QUEST_20150323_001661	There was a young couple that used to work here. They were very diligent. {nl}Everyone here did not work hard because they hated Shaton but they were different. 
QUEST_20150323_001662	But that Shaton abused and exploited them. {nl}They ended up dying of overwork. I have some of their keepsakes... {nl}I promised to bury it near the grave but I lost the bag I kept them in in the chaos of Medzio Diena. {nl}If you find an old bag, please check if there's a ring inside. 
QUEST_20150323_001663	Good. This potion cost me a fortune at the Fedimian Black Market. {nl}It was from an elementalist who seemed trustworthy, unlike those druids. {nl}According to him, this potion contains the essence of Alchimie. 
QUEST_20150323_001664	He said if I pour this on the ground, a powerful obedient monster will appear. {nl}I'll use it to wipe out all the monsters in my farm!
QUEST_20150323_001665	Well, I've made some mistakes here and there but who doesn't? {nl}I mean, just look at grapes. How can you use water without wine mixed as drinking water? {nl}Even if the world is ending, you can't just drink plain water. That's barbaric! {nl}Hmm! Anyway, I appreciate the help. I'll listen to your story.
QUEST_20150323_001666	I'm just listening! I'm not going to do what you say! {nl}I don't think wheat will grow here no matter what kind of magic you use. {nl}I need to look for my son's body, so you better keep it short!
QUEST_20150323_001667	The wandering girl the farmers mentioned sounds suspicious. {nl}Elly agrees with me too. {nl}Looking at the facts together with her actions, we can't just dismiss her as an ordinary girl. {nl}Won't people in the Shaton family do anything about it? 
QUEST_20150323_001668	And Medzio Diena came a few years after. {nl}My family barely made it out alive and this is what happened to the farm. {nl}That's not all. {nl}It was mentioned that a blue disaster will follow the great disaster.
QUEST_20150323_001669	Think about it, it may have been a warning about those poisonous grapes. {nl}The true gold blessing will come after the blue disaster passes. I don't know what that means. {nl}I wanted to talk to her more but her father kicked her out saying she felt ominous. {nl}Where could she be wandering now...
QUEST_20150323_001670	Thank you. {nl}Maybe we earned some of the master's trust. {nl}If so, then it's all thanks to you. {nl}Good luck...
QUEST_20150323_001671	I heard things went well at the Shaton Farm. {nl}That's a relief. I will discuss with the master about the Groß-scale purification and how to make it successful.

QUEST_20150511_001995	(Everything is scribbled so poorly that they can't be distinguished from letters or drawings.)
QUEST_20150511_001996	The facility that belonged to the workers who worked on the Mausoleum of Zachariel suddenly shut down. {nl}It's not like they left because finishing it was hopeless, but they just vanished all at once. {nl}Maybe it is related to the irregularly big size of the tomb and its complicated composition {nl}even after considering the fact that it was the grave to commemorate the greatest king in history.

QUEST_20150511_002003	For the first step: recharge the magical essence I gave to you.

QUEST_20150511_002008	Every object possess the inner strength of its possessor. {nl}And to add to the magical interpretations on that, they could also transform the shapes of their possessors. {nl}Objects belonging to demons could do it with relative ease. (The same applies to the sacred areas, but don't even dare doing that in those places.)
QUEST_20150511_002009	But that's still just a theory despite the efforts of many frontiers. {nl}The possessor's inner strength and interpretations can never be fully understood if it were not for the possessor himself. {nl}That's why we hope for the blessing from the goddess or the wisdom from the possessor for the knowledge we lack.

QUEST_20150511_002012	We've finally arrived in front of the Zachariel's Mausoleum. {nl}He was the first king of this kingdom and used an enormous number of people to build it. {nl}I believe only this place can answer the question I've had in my mind for a long time.
QUEST_20150511_002013	What was he trying to protect with this gigantic Royal Mausoleum? {nl}The answer must be inside, but the bleak atmosphere the interior exudes makes me hesitate to enter.
QUEST_20150511_002014	There's something inside the dark tomb.{nl}As I advanced inside, the Groß stone statues all turned to look down at me and then chased me out. {nl}I guess the great king in the past is still the great king in the present. {nl}I better investigate from the pillar outside of the Royal Mausoleum.
QUEST_20150511_002015	With the help from a young, kind historian, I was able to find a big clue. {nl}Yes. The best place to hide a tree is in a forest. {nl}Ruko Plateau and the King's Plateau... I'm so close I can almost touch it. {nl}I'm confident the goddess sent him to me. May the blessing of the goddess always be with us!
QUEST_20150511_002016	Some pillars unlock the tomb{nl}and some altars lock it.{nl}The magical energy that surrounds{nl}the tomb moves by a key.{nl}But none among us can be that key. {nl}We were not Chosen.
QUEST_20150511_002017	The curse disturbs the rules of the universe that are being controlled by the goddess through human greed. {nl}These rules in the human world get influenced by the personalities of each person, their abilities and their potential power. {nl}The cases when these abilities get released depend on the conditions above.
QUEST_20150511_002018	According to the old writing left on the Great Cathedral, that is using a small part of the goddess' abilities secretly. {nl}Some people say that after seducing the weak minds of people, the demons used them for the source of the curse. {nl}May the goddess bless you!
QUEST_20150511_002019	There are two ways to release the curse: {nl}Remove the curse using a greater power or eliminate its caster. {nl}
QUEST_20150511_002020	Removing the curse using a greater power: {nl}This way depends on whether the power that overwhelms the curse comes from good or evil and from darkness or light.{nl}{nl}The most important factor for eliminating the caster: {nl}Even after eliminating the caster, the curse may not be removed due to other factors.{nl}{nl}I have no doubt that the power of the goddess is stronger.
QUEST_20150511_002021	There are mainly two ways to spread the curse. {nl}First, using equipment and uttering simple words. It sounds easy but it is, in fact, the hardest way. {nl}Therefore, from the example of the Pilgrim's Way, we mainly use the cursed ones as the mediums to spread the curse.
QUEST_20150511_002022	When a caster makes a curse, the caster has a tremendous influence on the mind of the victim. Their ego usually can't endure the feeling of guilt this causes. {nl}It seems the magic that was used on the cursed city of Ruklys is of a higher level than the one used on Naktis. We need to look into it more.

QUEST_20150714_002076	As I was retreating from the Royal Army, I encountered many demons. {nl}It doesn't make sense. Where did they come from?
QUEST_20150714_002077	There's no hope at all. Ah... my lovely Ridell. {nl}The kingdom soldiers did not keep their word. We're all going to die.
QUEST_20150714_002078	Those soldiers of the Royal Army! Especially Premier Eminent! {nl}They're no different from demons. Even the goddesses would not forgive them.
QUEST_20150714_002079	I don't want to die. {nl}We were just following the goddesses' words. {nl}Everyone is killing each other in the names of the goddesses. {nl}Who has deceived us? {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002080	Royal Army Recruit Propaganda
QUEST_20150714_002081	The Royal Army needs competent people like you! {nl}Loyalty to the kingdom! To victory and a brighter future!
QUEST_20150714_002082	Pledge loyalty to the Royal Army and become a new and better person. {nl}The goddesses protect our armies.
QUEST_20150714_002083	Life and death... which one would you choose? {nl}The only way to survive is to swear loyalty to the kingdom!
QUEST_20150714_002084	Don't forget that the Royal Army has won 600 years ago. {nl}Join us. You sins can be forgiven.

QUEST_20150714_002086	The supplies should be here soon... {nl}Are they going to be late again?
QUEST_20150714_002087	You will need various tools when traveling. {nl}It's better to buy them in advance.
QUEST_20150714_002088	Göttin Laima … Tatsächlich kenn ich sie nicht so gut. Sie tut nichts, außer für ihren Priester.{nl}Ich habe gehört sie ist die Göttin des Schicksals und der Voraussicht, aber sie ist vor uns nicht einmal erschienen.
QUEST_20150714_002089	Ich erinnere mich an etwas, jetzt wo ich gerade mit dir spreche.{nl}Vielleicht wusste Göttin Laima alles im voraus über die Katastrophe.
QUEST_20150714_002090	Ich bete jeden Tag zu Göttin Gabija. Es hält das Haus warm.{nl}Wie du vielleicht schon weißt, kontrolliert Göttin Gabija das Feuer und ich bin Hausfrau, dadurch bin ich dem Feuer sehr nahe.
QUEST_20150714_002091	If you cleverly use the dry air that forms around areas of severe cold, {nl}you'd be able to freeze any object even in a desert. {nl}{nl}However, if you can't receive the blessing from the goddess, {nl}it won't be possible to make that kind of air.
QUEST_20150714_002092	The Records of the Master Himself
QUEST_20150714_002093	I've studied magic for a long time as a sorcerer. {nl}From the process, the advancement of sorcery can't be explained without relating with demons, {nl}and since they've fought against the goddesses, {nl}the field has been widened to the study of the goddesses as well.
QUEST_20150714_002094	While I was doing that, I learned of the field of accumulation. {nl}It's an empty field. The theory of the beginning and the end is a fantastic library,{nl}at the boundary of transcendency, all for one purpose.
QUEST_20150714_002095	Records about Disciple Laius
QUEST_20150714_002096	My other disciple, Laius, is clever and a fast learner but has an insatiable greed for knowledge. {nl}I am worried that he may fail the task. {nl}A scholar should always try to learn, but obsessing about it will make one walk the wrong path.
QUEST_20150714_002097	Despite that, Laius is a disciple I acknowledge. {nl}His passion towards me and knowledge is just being expressed in a wrong way.
QUEST_20150714_002098	I hope Laius realizes this himself. {nl}Since he is my disciple, I believe he can do it.
QUEST_20150714_002099	Records about Disciple Hones
QUEST_20150714_002100	Among my disciples, two of them followed me until my later years and,{nl}will be my successors after my death.
QUEST_20150714_002101	Hones, who is one of them, is lacking in scholarly intelligence. {nl}However, I am sure his faithfulness and efforts will help him follow my teachings.
QUEST_20150714_002102	Records of the Hidden Object
QUEST_20150714_002103	...I don't know whether I should thank the goddesses for this discovery or not. My greed for knowledge can ruin the world.
QUEST_20150714_002104	I can't sleep well for fear of my research results being spread by demon investigation. {nl}That's why I wish to pass the rest of the research to the one I can trust.
QUEST_20150714_002105	The Inheritance of the Master
QUEST_20150714_002106	As the priests and theologians know, Goddess Vibora is in charge of the library,{nl}where all records of the world are stored. I was able to check several records in that {nl}fantastic library after the research and long studying I can't tell anyone about at the moment. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002107	From the many records of the goddess, I was only able to see a few. {nl}Nevertheless, the fact that I checked the existence of the records with the important facts {nl}was astonishing. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002108	The record which I can use to find the whereabouts of all the goddesses... {nl}If one had such secret information, it would be possible to predict the goddesses' {nl}future locations by analyzing what they did in the past. {nl}Because of that, their future plans may be disturbed or put at risk. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002109	This is more dangerous because, if the demons find out the truth, {nl}their desire for the library will grow and, if they do acquire that knowledge, {nl}the world will be swallowed by evil. That's why - {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002110	(The rest is blurred and unreadable.)
QUEST_20150714_002111	Disciple Hones' Memo
QUEST_20150714_002112	If you want to find the master's research, you have to find three spatial magic stones {nl}and activate the fusion device.
QUEST_20150714_002113	The Spatial Magie Edelstein of Contract is at the reception room. {nl}The monsters probably have the fragments. {nl}Collect all the fragments of the magical stones and go to the{nl}preserved magic field in the Grave of the Saints to restore them.
QUEST_20150714_002114	The Spatial Magie Edelstein of Offer is with the Templeshooter. {nl}The Wisdom Guiding Stone will help you find the hidden Templeshooter.
QUEST_20150714_002115	The Spatial Magie Edelstein of Promise can be found in Siaura Mine. {nl}Use the Seelenkristall on the monsters first to collect their Kondensierter Spite. {nl}With that, destroy the stones in Siaura Mine. {nl}Black Chasers will pursue from behind, avoid them and go to the end of the mine{nl}to find the magic gem.
QUEST_20150714_002116	When you find all three spatial magic gems, go to the fusion device again,{nl}and place the magic gems there. {nl}The path to the master's research will then open at the Laudi Tower.
QUEST_20150714_002117	Spirit
QUEST_20150714_002118	Please... save us from this horrible contract... {nl}Remove us from this... Contract of Enunciation...
QUEST_20150714_002119	The Contract of Enunciation... {nl} we'll vanish if we speak... I have no regrets...
QUEST_20150714_002120	Eternal imprisonment... from the restraints of the contract... {nl}Break... the Pot of Silence...
QUEST_20150714_002121	The Pot of Silence is at Memum Corridor... {nl}I'm so... exhausted...
QUEST_20150714_002122	Where to start...
QUEST_20150714_002123	I was a disciple of Agailla Flurry when I was alive. {nl}I didn't have any magical abilities so I couldn't use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002124	That's why I survived Helgasercle's wrath. {nl}She must've thought she didn't have to kill me since I wasn't able to use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002125	I am confident I am better when it comes to theories than other disciples... {nl}That's why I studied magic. And in my studies, I learned of the magic stone of interaction.
QUEST_20150714_002126	I came here when Helgasercle attacked the Mage Tower. {nl}I thought that if I could use the magic stone of interaction, I'd be able to use magic.
QUEST_20150714_002127	But, Archon drove me away from the Mage Tower. {nl}Due to this disturbance, the magic stone activated defensive magic, linking my,{nl}and Archon's spirit to each other.
QUEST_20150714_002128	As a result, Archon was sealed and my body disappeared without a trace. {nl}We became shackled to each other.
QUEST_20150714_002129	I've been tied here for hundreds of years... {nl}Since I can't do anything with my astral body.
QUEST_20150714_002130	The bigger problem is that Archon was released as well. {nl}I lost the body, but Archon, who is a demon, is still alive.
QUEST_20150714_002131	Memorial Stone
QUEST_20150714_002132	By avoiding the eyes of Helgasercle, I was able to come here to continue my research. {nl}I needed to find a way. A way to reduce the power of demons and increase that magical power.
QUEST_20150714_002133	By my name, Valius, the one who walks the way of Linker, {nl}I swear that I will not surrender to the demons.
QUEST_20150714_002134	I've made many magical tools, but I wasn't able to repel the attacks of the demons. {nl}Without checking out the result, I close my eyes.
QUEST_20150714_002135	Records of Investigation
QUEST_20150714_002136	The basics of Linker magic are to find the common factors in each others' spirits. {nl}So it is impossible if the acceptor does not possess any magical abilities or bases. {nl}
QUEST_20150714_002137	I've completed the first stage magic stone. {nl}It still does not satisfy the previous objective of delivering the perfect magic,{nl}and magical power somewhat.{nl}But now, at last it is possible to accept Linker Magie even without magical ability.{nl}
QUEST_20150714_002138	Proposal
QUEST_20150714_002139	If a magician finds a way to share all his abilities and knowledge with another, {nl}then even those without magical abilities can become a strong magician,{nl}within a short period of time.
QUEST_20150714_002140	This way, you'd be able to hide from the eyes of Helgasercle,{nl}who is extremely afraid of the disciple of Agailla Flurry appearing.
QUEST_20150714_002141	However, I'm not sure if this is at all possible or whether or not it will have any side effects.
QUEST_20150714_002142	Design Proposal
QUEST_20150714_002143	The magic stone of the interaction can be made to work on the behalf of a Linker. {nl}However, maintaining the stone of interaction requires a considerable amount of magical power.
QUEST_20150714_002144	Hence, we decided to maintain the magic stone of the interaction {nl}with 12 regenerating magical power stones. {nl}If no problems arise, we will be able to maintain it, but if the magical power supply is cut, {nl}it won't last long.
QUEST_20150714_002145	Adrijus' Notice Board
QUEST_20150714_002146	I am looking for a stone rubbing of the tablet at the central sanctum. {nl}If you find any tablets with writings engraved, make a rubbing off of it. {nl}- Adrijus

QUEST_20150714_002148	It seems that someone has already made a rubbing since there is a vague trace of ink. {nl}Shall I read it?
QUEST_20150714_002149	King Kadumel finally dies.
QUEST_20150714_002150	Instead of the Mage Tower, the Tower of Fire would be a more fitting name for Flurry's tower.
QUEST_20150714_002151	This is a very secluded area so monsters usually prey around here. {nl}Be careful around here.
QUEST_20150714_002152	Research Records of Demetrius
QUEST_20150714_002153	In ancient times, humans lived with the goddesses. {nl}When I first heard of this piece of folklore, {nl}I thought it was made up out of respect for the goddesses. {nl}{nl}I started to investigate what historic background caused such reverence, {nl}as well as why this myth was created.
QUEST_20150714_002154	I increased the extent of my research. {nl}I traveled to many regions of the kingdom and collected similar cases. {nl}And I started to believe that this story was part of a bigger truth rather {nl}than just a small truth covered in fabrication.
QUEST_20150714_002155	The facts that we've discovered so far are thus: {nl}{nl}In the beginning, or a period not that far from the beginning, {nl}all humans used to live with the goddesses underground. {nl}I suppose the goddesses used to be more directly involved with humans. {nl}I have no idea why but soon, the humans left that place and scattered across the land.
QUEST_20150714_002156	This movement was made very naturally. {nl}If that hadn't been the case, then there must have been conflicts, {nl}and more fables would have been created as a result.
QUEST_20150714_002157	I believe the goddesses erased all memory and records of that time completely. {nl}However, we can't deny the possibility that another reason may exist {nl}due to the fact that this legend still remains despite the authority of the great goddesses.
QUEST_20150714_002158	And this is a very cautious prediction, but the creatures that we call demons{nl}may exist underground. {nl}{nl}Though that theory is hard to accept when we think about all the facts {nl}that are recorded in history and the present.
QUEST_20150714_002159	I can smell many Avietes. I heard they're effective... Could you share them with us?

QUEST_20150714_002167	I guess I'll take this tombstone rubbing to the person who wants it.
QUEST_20150714_002168	Since I've already made the rubbing, I'll give it to the person who wants it.

QUEST_20150714_002192	The Basics of Ignition
QUEST_20150714_002193	Ignition differs by elements, but with the blessing from the goddess, there may be cases where we can ignore that. {nl}To do so, we should try hard to achieve the scholarly knowledge and the faithfulness to the goddesses.

QUEST_20150729_002310	Aiste asked the elderly beggar, {nl}'Did you by any chance pick up the Silber coins I dropped? Would you return them to me? I worked very hard everyday for those coins and really need them.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002311	The beggar was taken aback. Aiste was asking for the impossible. After all, finding dropped coins in Fedimian was unthinkable. {nl}The old beggar was about to explain this to Aiste but instead remarked, {nl}'I've also lost coins in this area. It would be nice if you looked for mine as you searched for yours.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002312	'Why don't you go to where you work and explain what happened to them? Make sure you look lost.' The beggar then hesitantly added, {nl}'In the meantime, I'll be looking for your Silber coins here.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002313	And so he said, {nl}'Just as you've been able to pick up all my fruit, you should be able to find your lost money at Fedimian, so do not tell me to give you a Sekunde pay.' {nl}The orchard owner's cold words brought tears to the girl's eyes. {nl}The sight broke his heart, but even so, he did not want to give her any more money. {nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002314	He was soon overtaken by guilt and said, {nl}'If you really need that money, you should go to the silversmith's.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002315	The silversmith, after hearing Aiste's story, stated, {nl}'Even for children it is foolish to be so careless. How could you not know that all money that falls on Fedimian soil disappears, never to be found again?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002316	Aiste was surprised by what the silversmith said and grew sad. {nl}After a while she asked, {nl}'Then why is it that such a cruel thing happens?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002317	Even the silversmith did not know the true answer, so he improvised, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna must be taking them.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002318	Hearing those words, Aiste replied, {nl}'Then I will just have to go ask the goddess.' {nl}The silversmith was astounded and replied, {nl}'While you're at it, why don't you ask the goddess to return my silverware?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002319	An exhausted Aiste soon arrived at the Statue der Göttin Zemyna. {nl}She prostrated herself before it and prayed to the Goddess Statue represented, her head completely down. {nl}'Oh, goddess. Please return my lost Silber coins.' {nl}Soon, while offering her prayers, Aiste could no longer hold in her sadness and she finally wept.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002320	How long did she pray crying? {nl}Suddenly, Aiste heard a voice addressed to her. {nl}'My child, have come to take back what you have lost?'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002321	The goddess' voice was heard again. {nl}'Aiste, what your asking from me is not in a method I approve of. Where I reign there is no harvest nor fruits to those who do not work.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002322	'But I worked very hard today!'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002323	'I know. So instead, I will give you and the others a chance. Look under your feet.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002324	After a number of steps, Aiste thought about the silversmith, {nl}and, again, went to his house and knocked on his door. {nl}As if the silversmith was waiting for her return, he opened the door immediately and said. {nl}'I'm sorry. I regret sending you away like that. I'll give you some Silber. {nl}This time, be careful not to drop any and get home safely.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002325	As the silversmith held out his Silber coins, Aiste shook her head and said,{nl}'No thank you, the goddess returned all my coins. On top of that she gave me even more. {nl}I remembered you saying you had also lost Silber, so I came to give you my extra coins. You don't need to give me yours.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002326	At first, the silversmith was skeptical about the coins being returned, {nl}so he was surprised when Aiste showed him genuine coins. After thinking for a while, the silversmith said, {nl}'Then how about this. You give me what you want while you accept what I was about to give you. {nl}Isn't that fair? On top of that I'll give you a pouch to carry your extra Silber.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002327	After leaving the silversmith's house, {nl}Aiste suddenly remembered that the old beggar must still be looking for her lost coins and worried about him. {nl}On her way to the beggar, she met the orchard owner again. {nl}Upon seeing Aiste, the orchard owner was overjoyed. {nl}'I was looking for you. I'm sorry for sending you off earlier. As an apology, I'll give you your salary again. {nl}Please be careful not to lose it this time.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002328	The orchard owner took out a Groß amount of coins, more than what Aiste's salary was, and handed it to her. {nl}However, Aiste shook her head and said, {nl}'Goddess Zemyna already returned my money to me. The silversmith also helped me, so now I actually have too much. {nl}Here, take a look.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002329	Disregarding the amount Aiste had shown him, the orchard owner said, {nl}'Well, even so, I would be ashamed for not giving you my due, so please just take it.' {nl}After saying this, the orchard owner stuffed his coins into Aiste's bag and left. {nl}By the time Aiste could muster up the energy to call the orchard owner, he was too far away.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002330	She hesitated for a moment but then set her mind on the beggar. {nl}After a bit of walking, Aiste arrived at where they met. The old beggar spotted her first and hurried over to her. {nl}He showed her the Silber coins he was clenching onto and said, 'Look! I found your lost Silber.' {nl}Aiste received the beggar's Silber and then showed the beggar her bag and said, {nl}'Look, I found your Silber coins too.'{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002331	After that, Aiste also held out her bag and said, {nl}'This is a gift as thanks for looking for my Silber. I was given this through Goddess Zemyna's grace.' {nl}Aiste then left before the Old Beggar could figure out how to reply.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002332	Over the jingling sound of gold, the old woman muttered. {nl}'If these two pieces of gold could ever marry, the baby gold would make me rich... but there's no life in these things...' {nl}Modestas heard those words, and decided to comment. {nl}'That gold won't make you rich by itself, so just put it into something worthwhile. {nl}Do you really think muttering at baby gold will do something?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002333	The old woman spoke plainly, 'Why not? If this way bears fruit, it'll be safe and secure.' {nl}'That's ridiculous. You should do what I do and gamble.' {nl}The woman was incensed.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002334	'So, you think your betting ways are better?' {nl}'Why wouldn't I? There are moments where I could win or lose, but your way won't make any gold at all.' {nl}With Modestas' words, the old woman paused in thought. Finally, she said, {nl}'Then let's have a bet.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002335	The disturbing aura around her grew as soon as the offer reached Modestas' ears. He couldn't outright refuse. {nl}'What kind of bet?' {nl}'We'll see whether your way or my way will make us richer.' {nl}'And if I lose?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002336	'Don't worry about that. You will win, and you will lose - That won't change. The rules are fixed.' {nl}'What do you mean by that?' {nl}'By taking my offer, you will fail once, and you will win once. No matter what happens.' {nl}'Well, yeah. Winning and losing is how gambling works.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002337	'No. No matter how unlucky it may seem, you will win your first gamble. {nl}And then, no matter how favorable life may seem, you will fail the next.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002338	Modestas was still confused by these strange words. {nl}'So, you're saying I'll win on every odd bet, and lose on every even one?' {nl}'Yes. It will be so. You will win coin, and then you won't. Is that not fair? {nl}One coin will be enough to succeed, no matter how many bets you make. That is my offer.' {nl}'You think I'll switch between winning and losing, huh?{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002339	With her hand to her chin, the old woman gave a puzzling response. {nl}'Three times each, should be enough. Return to me after you make six gambles. {nl}Naturally, if you don't have more coin after your sixth bet, I will win.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002340	Modestas seemed to tremble. 'How much should I earn, then?' {nl}'You start with one gold piece,' she replied, 'and when you return, show me all your gold pieces but that one. {nl}If you stretch that single piece to anything more, then you win. As for the time... you have one week.' {nl}'So, what do you get when I lose?' Modestas reminded her.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002341	'Well...' the old woman lingered, 'If you win, everyone will know about my gold - {nl}and you'll have the power of winning and losing. On the other hand...' {nl}''On the other hand...'?' Modestas said, tensely.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002342	'When I win, then after this, the friends you know will disappear every time you lose a bet.' {nl}Modestas was unnerved by the conditions set. He did not immediately object, but thought of the victory, {nl}and soon accepted. Modestas was, most of all, the kind of person who never backed down.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002343	Are you not busy? You seemed in a hurry on your horse before you passed by for a talk. You should stop worrying about me and go.' {nl} Sigfried, hearing Modestas' words, replied, {nl} 'I was busy, but I still have time to walk with you for another 10 minutes or so. This horse might not seem like much, but when it comes down to it he can go pretty fast.' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002344	Seeing Sigfried not budge, Modestas tried again to persuade him, {nl} 'Wouldn't it be better to be early as opposed to be on time?' {nl} {nl} Hearing this, Sigfried became adamant, {nl} 'Do you not believe what I just said or are you willfully ignoring it all?' {nl} A disconcerted Modestas said, {nl} 'No, I didn't mean it like that......' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002345	However, before Modestas could say any more, Sigfried said, 'If you don't believe me, why don't we have a bet?' {nl} {nl} Naturally, the words, 'Sure. What do you want to wager?' rose up in Modestas' throat.
QUEST_20150729_002346	Considering Modestas' habit, to simply not immediately accept a gamble took superhuman willpower from him. {nl} 'What...  what kind of bet?' {nl} 'We were going to bet on whether my horse is fast or not.' {nl} Modestas desperately fought his inner gambler.
QUEST_20150729_002347	As soon as the bet started, Sigfried tried every method possible to command his horse to move. Despite his efforts it didn't move a single hoof at all.{nl}At the end, Sigfried repeatedly cursed its strange behavior. Realizing he'd be late to his appointment without a horse, he threw the reins to Modestas and sprinted away.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002348	As Sigfried disappeared, Modestas felt uncomfortable.
QUEST_20150729_002349	You, the young man with the horse, can you come over and help us for a bit?' {nl} Modestas had no idea what these soldiers needed help for, but since he could no longer ignore them, he decided to head over. {nl} Once Modestas arrived, one of the soldiers said, {nl} 'You came at just the right time. We would like you to referee a small gamble we're about to make here.' {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002350	What started as a small banter turned into a big argument, which finally grew to become a big money bet. The soldiers had already gathered their money and only had to decide the winner. Unfortunately, every goddess got equal votes and a winner couldn't be decided.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002351	Thus, the soldiers decided to settle the bet by calling the first person who passed by, asking him who he thought the best goddess is, and deciding the winner from there. The soldiers agreed that the first passer-by would symbolize the will of whatever goddess he supported. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002352	Since a big jackpot was on the line, the soldiers waited with bated breath for Modestas' answer. {nl}Knowing there was no right answer to the question, Modestas simply said aloud the name of his favorite goddess. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002353	When he did, the soldiers reacted strangely. {nl} There was supposed to be an ecstatic winner and disappointed losers, but nobody seemed joyful nor disappointed. Instead, everyone had a bewildered look on their faces. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002354	Modestas, perplexed by their reaction, asked for an explanation to which one of the soldiers answered, {nl}'We originally had votes for four goddesses but your choice isn't any of them, so now we have five goddesses.' {nl}Then the soldiers resumed their squabble about how to decide the winner. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002355	The mood began to deteriorate so Modestas wanted to leave them. {nl}When he was about to take off, the soldiers blocked his path and accused him.{nl}'It's your fault the argument heated up even more. You're not thinking of just leaving are you?'{nl}Intimidated by the irritated soldiers, Modestas dared not to escape. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002356	Knowing Modestas, he could not simply sit on the sidelines watching a big bet grow. Eventually, he became enticed to join.
QUEST_20150729_002357	Modestas, caught in the heat of the moment and ending up participating in the soldier's bet, finally remembered it was his turn to lose.{nl}But it was too late.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002358	If you think about it, even if it was his turn to lose, all it took for him to lose was one more vote for any of the goddesses he didn't choose. With the odds of the next person walking by supporting his goddess being against him, the probability of winning was low anyway.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002359	However, the victor was chosen unexpectedly. A commanding officer found the soldiers slacking, disciplined them and was about to lead them away. {nl}The soldiers, obeying the superior's command, were about to march off when they shrewdly asked him which goddess he favored. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002360	Someone approached Modestas who had been lying down hurt and helped him get back on his feet. He turned out to be one of the people standing on the side, the wagon owner. {nl}The man who helped Modestas uttered with relief, {nl}'I am glad you're not too hurt. Your horse also didn't hurt himself tripping over that pit.'{nl}Modestas noticed a well-hidden pit where he pointed. {nl}The wagon owner continued.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002361	'My horse became injured here and can no longer pull my wagon. It's just an empty wagon, but at any rate, it won't be going anywhere for a while. That's why I have a proposition. Won't you sell me your horse? I believe with a healthy horse pulling the wagon, even my injured horse can help pull it in some way.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002362	It was an unexpected suggestion, but Modestas had to ride the horse to quickly find and catch up to the soldiers. He immediately refused the offer.{nl}The wagon owner tried to explain there was no way his injured horse can pull the wagon alone but Modestas was not persuaded. After his repeated refusal, the wagon owner offered a new suggestion.{nl}'Then let's do this. What if you buy my wagon? I will sell it for cheap. Since my injured horse can't pull the wagon, it will be better off in your hands.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002363	Modestas, after saying he'll be back if he loses the bet, began to rein his horse when the old Alchemist let out an eerie cackle. This caught Modestas' attention, who turned around and looked at his person.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002364	And right before his eyes, the lead nugget prize let out a sparkle and in a moment clearly became gold. {nl} The old Alchemist now snickered, 'Now you owe me one gold nugget, be sure to bring it.' {nl} Modestas protested, but as much as he looked, what the old Alchemist now held was clearly no longer lead. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002365	This time, no matter what, I have to wage a bet against the world's richest, well maybe not the richest, but a wealthy man at the very least.'{nl}As soon as he uttered these words, his surroundings shook like an earthquake and a heavy, deep voice declared.{nl}'I am the richest in this region.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002366	Modestas scanned his surroundings but failed to find anyone. So he asked,{nl}'Who are you?'{nl}The heavy deep voice answered his question.{nl}'I am where you stand. In your tongue, I am called the mountain.'{nl}Modestas in disbelief, couldn't help but talk back.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002367	You are... the mountain?'{nl}'That is correct. I am the mountain, and just as you are looking for, the richest around here.'{nl}'You are the mountain? Well, no, even if you are the mountain, how can you claim to be the richest?'{nl}'I own much land for my sierra stretches far. Further in me I contain Groß valuable lodes.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002368	Even if the mountain's veins contained nothing but rocks, he thought he could end up owning a Groß quarry to dig out valuable stones. Instead, the mountain had paid an inadequate reward.{nl}When Modestas pointed it out, the mountain disagreed.{nl}'All you own are two horses and a wagon.'
QUEST_20150729_002369	Surely one must wage things of equal value. This boulder is worth as much as you own.'{nl}With that said, the mountain returned to his former self, never to deal with Modestas nor anyone else ever again. {nl}Modestas, in his desperate situation, had wasted his crucial chance to just win one big boulder.{nl}Despite his bad luck, he consoled himself knowing at least he had horses and a wagon to transport the boulder.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002370	In front of Modestas, who had been worrying, appeared a familiar figure. It was none other than the one who had started the bet, the suspicious old woman.{nl}The old woman asked Modestas.{nl}'How is it? Is it going well?'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002371	Modestas confessed he was far from making profits, instead being in debt, and he had wasted all his chances to win and only had his last, losing bet remaining.{nl}After listening to his story the old woman flatly added, {nl}'Since you only have one bet left, go ahead and make your last losing bet. Then all that's left for you to do is pay up your end of the bargain for losing the bet against me.'{nl}Modestas was a man who loved to gamble but he was not the type to throw a tantrum nor was he a sore loser.
QUEST_20150729_002372	'Since you are unsure how to transport this boulder you suddenly won, how about this? Normally, I wouldn't change the initial conditions, but as an amusement I will give you a suggestion. Why don't you use your last bet to see whether or not I can lift this boulder up into your wagon? Even if you lose, at least you can have this heavy boulder loaded on your wagon.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002373	Modestas who had nothing to lose, nodded his head to accept her proposal. But before he could consent to the bet, the old woman continued. {nl}'But I can't just give you such a favorable idea for free. Therefore I will add one more condition.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002374	When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Since you already lost the bet against me, although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance. How about it?'{nl}Like always Modestas had no choice.
QUEST_20150729_002375	When the boulder was set in its proper place with the help of the soldiers, the Alchemist who had left returned with another person. The Alchemist had brought with him a famous Dievdirbys sculptor.{nl}To the famous Dievdirbys, the Alchemist suggested, {nl}'Why don't you sculpt a statue of a goddess using this boulder, on this central site of Klaipeda? If this boulder is changed into a statue of a goddess, then nobody in Klaipeda will be able to deny its significance. I think that will fulfill your promise to the old woman.'{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002376	That the old woman appeared before him, that the many bets occurred, that the mountain erupted a stone for material was the divine providence of the goddesses, argued Modestas, persuading everyone. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002377	Thus, the people decided to follow the words of Modestas, and Modestas relayed to the Dievdirbys the order to create the statue. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002378	When the statue was finally finished, the citizens of Klaipeda gathered, curious to know the identity of the goddess who had been raised in the center of their beloved city.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002379	The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}
QUEST_20150729_002380	Despite the numerous questions nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002381	Since that time, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing. The answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002382	But no matter the impossible odds, Modestas never lost a bet. Therefore nobody was able to win the answer from Modestas for years and time flew by.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002383	And, as he lay dying, Modestas revealed the secret to the Goddess Statue in his will. When all became clear, the one who orchestrated all of this was none other than the one whom all other goddesses stem from, Goddess Ausrine.{nl}
QUEST_20150729_002384	In the end, Goddess Ausrine, in exchange for giving income and an interesting life full of mystery to a certain gambler from Klaipeda, gave the city of Klaipeda a beautiful Goddess Statue, and a tale to last for times to come.{nl} {nl}

QUEST_20151224_003061	It's very important to maintain a relaxed mind when using magic.{nl}Not only can you not be able to use magic when losing your composure, {nl}you might also find yourself in danger.{nl}

QUEST_20151224_003070	The Mage Society discovered that Zerai's powers were not exclusive,{nl}and could be learned by anyone regardless of their condition.{nl}Very much like magic itself.{nl}
QUEST_20151224_003071	That is how Zerai became an official member and the first Psychokino Master {nl}ever to be recognized by the Mage Society.{nl}Of course, at the time, it is said he himself did not know he would become the founder {nl}of a new branch of magic.
QUEST_20151224_003072	...As such, when a Psychokino's magic manifests itself, the results are identical,{nl} but there are in fact two ways this can happen.{nl}The first way is when one materializes supernatural powers in the form of regular spells.{nl}
QUEST_20151224_003073	The other way is a very particular case, like the one that originated this very branch of magic. {nl}It happens only to a few gifted people whose supernatural powers manifest naturally.{nl}

QUEST_20151224_003078	...People can develop psychological problems from focusing on the same thing for too long; this happens not just with magic but with general things as well.{nl}Especially for the magicians in the Mage Tower... For those who only wish to compete against other magicians, always focusing on their predecessors' achievements, there is a more of a chance this could happen.{nl}
QUEST_20151224_003079	So who should be in charge of controlling and preventing these issues for other magicians?{nl}Without us Psychokinos to watch over them, another magician could easily slip into madness, and should he or she be powerful enough, there is no knowing what things they could be capable of in the Mage Tower or out in the world.{nl}Antares is one such powerful magician...{nl}

QUEST_20151224_003098	The advantage of using a bow is that you can finish an opponent from afar.{nl}Of course that is meaningless if you can't aim, haha.

QUEST_20151224_003102	Shields, rocks, monsters, you need to use anything you can.{nl}There's no such thing as being shy in battle.

QUEST_20151224_003109	Since poison is Wugishis' specialty, people tend to avoid them out of fear.{nl}It's not like they use poison everywhere they go, so there's no real reason to worry.{nl}...Although, I suppose that doesn't change the fact that poison is actually dangerous.

QUEST_20151224_003121	Are you saying you can read the secret writings on the scroll AND came to find me?{nl}That's unexpected... Ah, I'm sorry for what I said earlier.{nl}

QUEST_20160224_003627	Book written in Runic Characters
QUEST_20160224_003628	This is a story about the nearly forgotten runic characters.{nl}Runic characters had been used since before the foundation of the kingdom by smaller northern tribes.{nl}Peculiarly, these people believed that the characters held magical powers.{nl}That's the reason why the northern people spent a long time to find those powers.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003629	Finally, a person was able to find the powers dwelling in the runic characters.{nl}They do not have any powers by themselves, but they are a channel for powers that can only be manifested through them...{nl}That was the secret behind the runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003630	He went straight to Goddess Saule and told her of the hidden powers of the runic characters, and the goddess rejoiced and blessed him.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003631	People came to call him a 'Rune Caster'.{nl}He became the first Rune Caster Master and fostered many more Rune Casters.{nl}He also created the Rune Stone so that the new Rune Casters would easily be able to use runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003632	One day, he vanished leaving only his Rune Stone behind.{nl}The Rune Stone he left behind has become a symbol of the way of the Rune Caster and has been passed down from master to master.
QUEST_20160224_003633	People often say that the goddesses are always with us.{nl}This is right not only in a spiritual sense but also a practical sense.{nl}That's because it symbolizes the fact that the goddesses are tending over us from their abodes.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003634	{nl}For instance, it is said that Goddess Vibora manages a massive library only permitted to the goddesses.{nl}This library is also the dwelling place of Goddess Vibora.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003635	{nl}Another example is the residence of Goddess Jurate which is rumored to be on a mysterious sea where human ships cannot reach.{nl}They say that a ship larger than most islands is the residence of Goddess Jurate.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003636	{nl}It is said that even Goddess Vakarine that goes around numerous locations has her own abode.{nl}Some say that there is a demon prison in a dimension that we do not know of, and that is the domain of Goddess Vakarine. {nl}But that is only one of the many locations that Goddess Vakarine visits.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003637	{nl}There are also legends that Goddess Laima has a palace deep underground where nobody knows of.{nl}There is no way to find it, it is also said that the Demon Goddess Giltine also resides there.
QUEST_20160224_003638	The Rune Stone...{nl}I haven't heard of that in a long time.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003639	In the past, I've met a person that was searching for the {nl}special powers hidden within the runic characters.{nl}He was filled with a pure passion for the task.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003640	He eventually found the hidden powers in the runic characters and became the first Rune Caster.{nl}A channel for power... The power of the runic characters was their {nl}ability to allow the casters to realized their strength through them.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003641	He crafted a Rune Stone to let others use the powers of the Rune Stone with easier access.{nl}Although his Rune Stone was nothing extraordinary, the following generations of {nl}Rune Caster Masters have carefully guarded his Rune Stone out of respect...{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003642	Unfortunately his Rune Stone was lost during the Petrified City incident.{nl}That is why the Rune Caster Master is still looking for his Rune Stone.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003643	The fact that you've come to me with knowledge of the Rune Stone... {nl}Perhaps it means that you were led here by its powers.
QUEST_20160224_003644	Yes. Although it is an old tale...{nl}I do have an idea of where the Rune Stone may be.{nl}{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003645	The last place I sensed the Rune Stone was at the Royal Mausoleum.{nl}But that was a long time ago... I don't recall exactly where I sensed it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003646	I remember the traveler that came to me asking for a blessing a few hundred years ago.{nl}He said that he had seen a mysterious stone with {nl}strange characters engraved on it near a waterfall.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003647	Unfortunately I was not able to know about what was occurring{nl}around the world after I had resolved to protect the revelation.{nl}Perhaps humans may know more about the whereabouts of the Rune Stone than I do.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003648	Yes. Maybe a human family that has survived for a long time such as the Jonas family...{nl}Someone that has eternal life like the Amjinas is sure to know something.
QUEST_20160224_003649	You mentioned 'Rune Stone', didn't you?{nl}Ah, could it be...{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003650	If you are talking about a stone with strange characters engraved on it, yes I do have one.{nl}I don't know how long it has been, but it has been in {nl}the possession of the Jonas family for generations.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003651	But it is treated as rubbish since there is no way of knowing what it is used for.{nl}Now I know it is Rune Stone thanks to you.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003652	Why are you searching for it though?
QUEST_20160224_003653	I see.{nl}It is useless in our hands, so we'll give it to you if you absolutely need it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003654	No matter how valuable an object may be, {nl}it has to be in the hands of someone that needs it to be worth anything.
QUEST_20160224_003655	You've come here in search of the Rune Stone?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003656	I don't know where you've heard of it, but I do have one.{nl}I threw a tantrum when I was young to get it when {nl}it was gifted to the Winterspoon family long ago.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003657	Though, that's already a few hundred years ago.{nl}Now where did I put it...
QUEST_20160224_003658	Oh, as it happens, I have it right here.{nl}I have no use for it, so you may have it if you need it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003659	It may have been destined for you since you are the first person {nl}to seek something that nobody wanted for hundreds of years.{nl}As a handler of time, I am thinking that perhaps it was a future promised in the past.
QUEST_20160224_003660	I can't seem to find where I've put it.{nl}I'll keep an eye out for it, so would you mind coming back later?
QUEST_20160224_003661	Do you mean the Rune Stone?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003662	I don't have anything like that...{nl}But I do have something that comes to mind.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003663	There is a place in West Siauliai Woods that cannot be accessed through ordinary means.{nl}I had faintly sensed a mysterious aura for a few hundred years...{nl}But I couldn't find a way to get there.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003664	Perhaps the item you are searching for may be there.{nl}How about taking a look if you know how to get there?
QUEST_20160224_003665	Do you know that there is a place in West Siauliai Woods {nl}that cannot be accessed by ordinary means?{nl}I had sensed a mysterious aura there for hundreds of years.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003666	I don't know how to get there, or what to expect to find there.{nl}You might be able to find something if you find a way to get there.
QUEST_20160224_003667	Rune Stone
QUEST_20160224_003668	(Unrecognizable characters are glowing.)
QUEST_20160224_003669	(It seems as if you require more Rune Stones.)
QUEST_20160224_003670	Something glowing seems to be embedded behind the tombstone.{nl}Take it out?
QUEST_20160224_003671	You can see many interesting things if you sit here.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003672	Not too long ago, a lady that seemed to be a mage came to ask something strange.{nl}I think she was looking for a stone engraved with characters that glow blue or something?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003673	I said I didn't know anything of the sort since I have never seen anything similar.{nl}She said something about going somewhere past Escanciu Dorf... I can't quite recall.
QUEST_20160224_003674	Rune Caster Master
QUEST_20160224_003675	Eh? Why am I sensing rune powers in you?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003676	Goodness! {nl}That is the Rune Stone of the first Rune Caster Master, isn't it?{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003677	How did you manage to find it?{nl}I've been looking all over for it...{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003678	That Rune Stone... Could you give it to me, please?{nl}Although it may not mean too much to ordinary people, {nl}it means a lot to Rune Caster Masters.
QUEST_20160224_003679	Thank you so much.{nl}The Rune Stone of the first Rune Caster Master is finally back in {nl}the hands of Rune Casters after hundreds of years thanks to you.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003680	I don't know if it is sufficient as a reward, but let me teach you a little about runic characters.{nl}While extremely rare, there are some books written in runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003681	Perhaps if your magic is compatible with the runic characters...{nl}You may be able to become a Rune Caster.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003682	No, I am certain that you will be able to become a Rune Caster.{nl}I think that the will of the runic characters led you here to me.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003683	Rune Casters can cast powerful magic through Rune Stones.{nl}However, it does take a long time to gather the required magic.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003684	Oh... Have I been talking too much about Rune Casters?{nl}My bad, but thank you so much for finding the Rune Stone.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003685	Come back to me if you wish to become a Rune Caster.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003686	I don't know if you could call it a reward, but I will teach you some runic characters.{nl}Although quite rare, there are occasionally some books written in runic characters.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003687	You may be able to obtain important information from long ago.{nl}Not a bad deal, don't you agree?

QUEST_20160224_003689	Ask an owl of the forest, and he will answer.{nl}Oh, birch tree, only the owls are there for you. {nl}Oh.... Only the owls...{nl}

QUEST_20160224_003702	Revelator, I've been waiting for you.{nl}Goddess Zemyna is hiding somewhere in this Earth Tower.
QUEST_20160224_003703	After the day in which you humans call Medzio Diena...{nl}Goddess Zemyna has hidden herself from the human realm.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003704	The life of humans and the fertility of vegetation...{nl}Medzio Diena must have been a great woe for the goddess of fertility.
QUEST_20160224_003705	We Kupoles have asked for her presence as the humans are longing for her...{nl}But Goddess Zemyna is obstinately refusing to meet us.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003706	To make things worse, the demons have started to attack the Earth Tower.{nl}It has become hard to even request a meeting with her because of the attacks.
QUEST_20160224_003707	Revelator, please find Goddess Zemyna.{nl}Maybe you will be able to change the goddess' mind.
QUEST_20160224_003708	If it helps finding Goddess Zemyna...{nl}I'll tell you what I know about the Earth Tower.
QUEST_20160224_003709	Unfortunately, there is not much I can tell you about Goddess Zemyna.{nl}I am sorry.
QUEST_20160224_003710	I pray that you will be able to meet Goddess Zemyna.
QUEST_20160224_003711	Relic Collector
QUEST_20160224_003712	They say that there are many artifacts from unknown periods in the Earth Tower.{nl}If you find something, how about exchanging for something I have?
QUEST_20160224_003713	There is someone who will want what we have even if the world ends.{nl}Our job is to supply it if there is a demand for it.
QUEST_20160224_003714	There is almost nothing known about the Istora Ruins.{nl}The fact that they were discovered thanks to being pushed up after Medzio Diena is about it.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003715	Then some adventures came to know about the Earth Tower here.{nl}It won't even open unless you are a Revelator.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003716	That's why we're making a living selling various of items to Revelators.{nl}Since only Revelators can carry relics from inside the tower.
QUEST_20160224_003717	One thousand and two hundred years ago...{nl}This tower has been built by the remaining vestiges of an ancient era forgetten by humans.{nl}
QUEST_20160224_003718	A long time ago, the humans that lived together with the goddesses...{nl}They created the tower out of desire for the goddesses.{nl}

QUEST_20160224_003721	As Goddess Zemyna does not wish to see anybody...{nl}I assume she is in the innermost depths of the tower.
QUEST_20160310_003722	Stories of battles with monsters and demons are always useful to the goddesses.{nl}Will you tell me a bit more?

QUEST_20160310_003736	We had lost a place to live after the trees grew too big and we couldn't eat the fruits, so Sarma's proposal appealed to us.{nl}He offered to share food with whoever helped him so most people from my village ended up accepting.{nl}
QUEST_20160310_003737	At first we worked hard to help him save our hometown.{nl}But then Sarma's research started to feel somewhat strange.{nl}It seems like Sarma's research has little to do with getting the overgrown trees back to normal.{nl}The experiments are mostly done on monsters, not on trees, and I've even fallen unconscious during one experiment.{nl}
QUEST_20160310_003738	I suspect Sarma is doing this to cover up for something evil.{nl}Since I have no proof, there's really nothing I can do.{nl}I can't ask you to trust every single word of mine,{nl}but I at least want to know if my suspicions are correct or if I'm simply overthinking it.{nl}

QUEST_20160811_004231	{nl}The pain was unimaginable.{nl}It was as if my entire body was burning down?
QUEST_20160811_004232	{nl}I realize there are still brothers who refuse to surrender.{nl}My words must sound like an excuse.
QUEST_20160811_004233	{nl}However... They're not just starving them, they're threatening their own lives!
QUEST_20160811_004234	{nl}When the goddesses Themselves show no signs of returning, there is no hope whatsoever.

QUEST_20160811_004236	{nl}I have with me a Revelator.{nl}Leave behind your past mistakes and help us take back the monastery.
QUEST_20160811_004237	What did you say?{nl}This is... a Revelator?
QUEST_20160811_004238	{nl}That means we have a real chance of expelling the Order from the monastery!{nl}
QUEST_20160811_004239	Please, let me help.{nl}I shall pay for my sin after we recover the monastery.
QUEST_20160811_004240	Very well. However...{nl}Did you happen to see the keeper of the monastery keys among the brothers who escaped?
QUEST_20160811_004241	I did see them, but...{nl}To tell you the truth about what happened... I'm very sorry.
QUEST_20160811_004242	{nl}The keeper was taken by High Officer Medea and lost their life.{nl}The keys are with Medeja now, I'm afraid.

QUEST_20160811_004244	{nl}She specializes in hallucinations.{nl}She can make others see what she wants, I imagine that's why she was working outside the monastery.
QUEST_20160811_004245	{nl}She did say, however, that she had been sent by the High Officer of an organization above the Order.{nl}The strong divine energy of the monastery was interfering with their power; she came to suppress it.
QUEST_20160811_004246	{nl}High Officer Domantas is also attempting to contaminate the energy of the monastery.{nl}They both want to suppress its divine power.
QUEST_20160811_004247	{nl}I was called for this very same task and was reporting to them the locations where the energy is strongest.
QUEST_20160811_004248	It's a shame to see such a kind person gone...{nl}But this is not the time to commiserate.
QUEST_20160811_004249	{nl}We must stop Medea's cruel deeds and take back the keys to the monastery.{nl}Brother Matas. How can we lure Medea?
QUEST_20160811_004250	Destroying the energy suppressing devices as you intended is likely the best way to go about it.{nl}There are more in Rijekavi Plains and Krasjia Hill.

QUEST_20160811_004254	{nl}You seem uncertain.{nl}There should be nothing more to hide now, should there?
QUEST_20160811_004255	Did you not hear about my specialty?{nl}That's a shame. The one called Stella is already under my power.
QUEST_20160811_004256	{nl}She's rather popular with the monks, isn't she? Having her surrender will do wonders in converting them.{nl}Do you see? This was all to get to you both.
QUEST_20160811_004257	{nl}I heard you defeated Domantas. Not quite the commoner, are you?{nl}And yet, you were no match for my wits.
QUEST_20160811_004258	{nl}You have no choice now but to become a loyal puppet of our Order.{nl}When my superiors see your talent, losing one or two devices will be nothing but a minor concern to them.
QUEST_20160811_004259	{nl}Now, convert to the Order.
QUEST_20160811_004260	Not a weak mind, I see, you can even move inside that magic circle.{nl}But then, I'd already figured that from the way you refused my kind proposal. I guess you've made your mind, then?
QUEST_20160811_004261	The magic circle is activated.{nl}Fortunately we have brother Matas watching out for us.
QUEST_20160811_004262	{nl}Let's head to the monastery now.

QUEST_20160811_004266	{nl}I heard a lot about you from the other monks. Nice to finally meet you.{nl}I figured you would do anything to come back, from the things I heard.
QUEST_20160811_004267	{nl}Are you perhaps here to rescue the brothers?{nl}Seeing how you broke the barrier, you seem not just brave but rather clever as well.
QUEST_20160811_004268	{nl}I'm afraid your brothers will soon join our Order, however.{nl}And you will be next, of course. The question is whether we need to force you or not.
QUEST_20160811_004269	{nl}The so-called Revelator you brought along has hurt my kin and can therefore not be spared, but you...{nl}I am giving you a final chance.
QUEST_20160811_004270	{nl}Be reborn under the Order of the Tree of Truth.

QUEST_20160811_004272	{nl}You are an abomination.{nl}Do not try to hide the fact that it's the demons who are behind you.
QUEST_20160811_004273	{nl}I am aware that you yourself are a demon.{nl}Know that for as long as we live, neither I nor the Revelator will ever abandon the grace of the goddesses.
QUEST_20160811_004274	{nl}Leave our monastery and release our brothers immediately!
QUEST_20160811_004275	It that your final choice?{nl}The noble martyr?

QUEST_20160811_004277	{nl}Let the Divine Tree take your spirit then, no one will ever even know you're dead.

QUEST_20161005_004389	Wait. I feel the energies of a Divine Spirit within you.{nl}How can this be?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004390	Is that... Gohei?{nl}It even has a Divine Spirit residing in it.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004391	It may be from one of the Miko Masters that came to the Kingdom long ago.{nl}You know, I think we can utilize it to help with the problems plaguing the Kingdom...
QUEST_20161005_004392	We seem to always be underhanded in this line of work.{nl}Come back to see me if you have an interest in becoming a Miko.{nl}

QUEST_20161005_004399	It's so irritating.{nl}I'm already busy as it is by myself, but there always seems to be something else that pops up.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004400	Not too long ago, I had to nurse a weakened Water Divine Spirit, as well as take care of a fiesty demon.{nl}I wasted time on the way back as well trying to help someone that was lost.{nl}I don't even know this area myself.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004401	Then I had to go and visit the Earth Divine Spirit, and also go and tend to a Divine Spirit who was depressed because the house he had been protecing had collapsed.{nl}Not only that...{nl}

QUEST_20161005_004404	I'm a Miko from a relatively famous Shrine outside of the Kingdom.{nl}I am researching the calamities that happened after Medzio Diena on the the orders of the Kannushi.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004405	It was all fine and well up to the point where I became the Miko Master...{nl}I haven't had a moment to rest after Medzio Diena.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004406	There I was, thinking that I would be able to relax in my room sipping tea after becoming Master.{nl}That was so naive of me...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004407	It's an annoyance, but the Kannushi did ask me to look into matters, and I can't really leave the Divine Spirits trembling in terror either.{nl}So that's why I am going around putting barriers up, finding Divine Spirits and settling matters.

QUEST_20161005_004421	I am a Divine Spirit helping the Miko Master Hitomiko.{nl}I know more about her than anyone else.
QUEST_20161005_004422	Hitomiko came here because of the Divine Spirits.{nl}Those who had been awakened long ago in the Capital.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004423	Any of the antique items from the Royal Family could have Divine Spirits residing in them.{nl}They have awakened by recieving spiritual energy from the Divine Tree for a long time.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004424	However, that spiritual energy was cut after Medzio Diena...{nl}They were about to... I believe the word they use here is 'explode'?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004425	Hitomiko couldn't let the precarious situation be left unattended...{nl}Especially since Princess Kaonilla could be put in danger, as she is always surrounded by the antiques of the Royal Family.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004426	That's why she came here, even though she knew she might not be welcomed.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004427	Why can't the Priests feel the Divine Spirits?{nl}Hmm... think of it as the inability to see things at a distance while using a magnifying glass.{nl}Though, I'm not quite sure myself.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004428	Hitomiko managed to gain Princess Kaonilla's permission to prepare the ritual.{nl}She needed to know how the Divine Spirits looked after Medzio Diena.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004429	I think that the ritual itself was nothing new to Hitomiko.{nl}However, it must have been something surreal to the royalty and priests watching her.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004430	You know, the way she would sway the Gohei and sprinkle something.{nl}Seeing blue energies emerge from certain items to go into Hitomiko's red pouch was a sight to behold.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004431	Finally, the red pouch was placed on the black table with the golden silks that Hitomiko had crafted...{nl}The pouch was then burned by Hitomiko, in front of numerous onlookers.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004432	I bet that was a sight to write down in any history books published after Medzio Diena.{nl}That's how Hitomiko was able to deal with the Divine Spirits near Princess Kaonilla.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004433	That wasn't all though.{nl}The Princess lost consciousness right after the ritual.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004434	The impressive performance hadn't ended though.{nl}Hitomiko remained calm as if she had expected this when nobody else had, and started moving towards the Princess.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004435	Hitomiko approached the throne where Kaonilla was and took a close look.{nl}Then she slowly turned around to all that were watching and said the following.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004436	There had been an evil Divine Spirit that had been possessing Princess Kaonilla...{nl}The evil Divine Spirit had gone to hide in the depths of the Princess' consciousness.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004437	I think she was trying to express the situation in terms that the people of the Kingdom could understand.{nl}Anyways, the room became silent before erupting in outrage.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004438	It was to be expected of course.{nl}It could've be interpreted as an attack on the Princess under the guise of performing a ritual to appease the Divine Spirits.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004439	However, Hitomiko calmed the people in the room and started talking to the priests.{nl}She said that she required their help as well in order to rid the Princess of the Divine Spirit...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004440	Hitomiko calmly told the priests what they needed to do.{nl}They took places near the throne where the Princess was sitting.{nl}After that... just imagine.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004441	All of the priests gathered under the guidance of Hitomiko...{nl}Using their powers on one person!{nl}I don't think that any evil presence could withstand such a situation.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004442	The Princess was able to regain consciousness.{nl}Even if she was a bit worn out.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004443	Hitomiko's work was recognized and she was given similar prestiege as the priests.{nl}In this Kingdom at least.
QUEST_20161005_004444	My signature for the petition? You think I'd just give it to you? {nl}No. At least pay me for it or something...
QUEST_20161005_004445	I'm dizzy. Come back later.
QUEST_20161005_004446	Ah, you're the one Adrijus sent. {nl}I've obtained the diluting solution he ordered. {nl}Be careful not to break the glass.
QUEST_20161005_004447	If you understand, start trying to think of a way to revert this.{nl}This simply cannot be ignored.

QUEST_20161005_004516	Goddess Jurate is on her boat and palace, the Kivotos.

QUEST_20161005_004519	The secret location within the Great Woodlands?{nl}There are more places where I don't know about even if I did hear them from Vaivora's Koru.
QUEST_20161005_004520	Goddess Laima captured by Giltine... Why would she be keeping Goddess Laima?
QUEST_20161005_004521	Unlike the others, Goddess Ausrine is somewhere mysterious where Koru can't talk about.
QUEST_20161005_004522	We've learned about the whereabouts of the Goddesses, but most of the locations are unfamiliar.
QUEST_20161005_004523	Sage Baseline
QUEST_20161005_004524	The underlying power of the Sage is magic.{nl}However, in order for that magic to actually be applied, a Sage requires two more things.{nl}One is the ability to focus magic on one location, and the other is a baseline on which to focus the energy.
QUEST_20161005_004525	If any wizard has enough magic to control space, the tenacity and concentration to focus that magic, all he would require is this baseline.
QUEST_20161005_004526	Sages can't usually use specific objects or geometry to focus magic as they cannot balance the otherworldly space that the Sages usually borrow or connect to.
QUEST_20161005_004527	This is like tying a rope to a twig before casting it into the abyss.{nl}Therefore, any baseline a Sage uses must always maintain a certain capacity. This means that there are sever limitations on what can be used.
QUEST_20161005_004528	A highly trained Sage might be able to use the mountains or the sea, but those will be much to large for most Sages to utilize.
QUEST_20161005_004529	 In other words, they are more than usable, but the Sages do not have the capacity to fully realize their properties.{nl}As such, suprisingly, most Sages are recommended to use the stars.
QUEST_20161005_004530	There are problems when using the stars as well.{nl}There are issues when connecting the wizards to stars far away and also to stars that can't be seen.
QUEST_20161005_004531	In practicality however, Sages can easily utilize stars even if they aren't skilled if they select to rely on the power of the Goddess that controls that star.
QUEST_20161005_004532	As can be seen by this fact, Sages also rely on the Blessing of the Goddesses in order to use magic just like Pyromancers.
QUEST_20161005_004533	The Goddess' Abode of Mount Monderor Volume I
QUEST_20161005_004534	The Goddess' Abode disappeared during the rule of King Jeromel the 2nd.{nl}More than 300 years after the foundation of the Kingdom, there are still many Goddesses and enemies that we don't even know about. As such, they would not have had any clues to which Goddess erased her traces at that time.
QUEST_20161005_004535	What is surprising is that despite the Kingdom's borders growing, the only Abode we know about and can approach above ground is the one at Mount Monderor.
QUEST_20161005_004536	Apart from that one, there is no history of a Goddess selecting a place for her abode that is accessible by humans.
QUEST_20161005_004537	It has been debated amongst many priests and scholars about whether the place at Mount Monderor was actually used by a Goddess.{nl}The decision was made by those that know best about the Goddesses, so I should be irrefutable.
QUEST_20161005_004538	Of course, the easiest way to reach the truth is for priests to ask their Goddess about their sister that lived at Mount Monderor.
QUEST_20161005_004539	However, as you might well be aware, the majority of prayers are focused on the well being of humanity and knowledge, not idle curiosity.
QUEST_20161005_004540	I consider it to be similar to why asking the Goddesses about our neighbor's private life is futile since it will never be answered.
QUEST_20161005_004541	Book of the Void
QUEST_20161005_004542	The book you are looking at is a literal wealth of information.{nl}However, there is not much information you will be able to gain from it other than the fact that you cannot learn from this book by reading it.
QUEST_20161005_004543	To be more precise, this book is a medium in which knowledge is stored in an otherworldly place and transfered to the Sage Master. As such, only the Sage Masters will ever be able to learn the knowledge being provided by this book.
QUEST_20161005_004544	If the person reading this book is currently walking the path of a wizard, we hope that you will return it to it's rightful owner.{nl}This book exists for only a certain moment and returns to a normal book after the next Sage Master learns from it.
QUEST_20161005_004545	Before or after that particular moment, this book may exist, but it will not have any particular meaning.
QUEST_20161005_004546	 New Inquisitor's Creed and Decree
QUEST_20161005_004547	We Inquisitors have prided ourselves to not have ever been lax in our duties even when the Goddess' were announcing their presence to you on a daily basis.
QUEST_20161005_004548	The duty of the Inquisitors has always been a heavy one as we cannot forgive those that imply that they are one with the Goddesses and have reached their authority.
QUEST_20161005_004549	Historically, the role of the Inquisitors have been about judging and settling petty disputes that arise between people due to the differences in how they view the Goddess' Blessing and not about the interactions between Goddess and human.
QUEST_20161005_004550	However, the horrid Medzio Diena occurred while I was Master and the Goddesses have disappeared making our responsibility even more important.{nl}The duty of recording and auditing the teachings of the Goddesses has become even more important after the confusion and destruction of Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20161005_004551	We have come to a state in which we now must make decisions ourselves when we had not needed to do so when the Goddesses were interacting with us.
QUEST_20161005_004552	I, the Inquisitor Master, am more overwhelmed than enthusiastic about this sudden increase in authority and reach.{nl}Even so, I shall gladly embrace these newly bestowed responsibilities and order all other Inquisitors to do the same.
QUEST_20161005_004553	This is the difference between our responsibilities and those of other priests in this era without the Goddesses post Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20161005_004554	We must prevent any discord between those of the cloth whether it be internal or external and this is the only way we will be able to stand in front of the Goddesses and humbly offer our achievements.{nl}Year 1096 of our Kingdom{nl}Inquisitor Master - Thomas Iquinostasys
QUEST_20161005_004555	Jane, who was the apprentice of Agailla Flurry, was unable to use magic.{nl}That's why she started research on how people like herself could use magic as well.
QUEST_20161005_004556	{nl}Wizards that followed in her footsteps invented Enchant Magic.{nl}It's a new branch of magic where wizards use their powers to give or extract magic from objects.
QUEST_20161005_004557	Allowing people that are unable to use magic to use magic is still a very difficult taks.{nl}That doesn't mean that we are going to give up on it.
QUEST_20161005_004558	{nl}We Enchanters are still tirelessly looking for better ways to do so through our research.
QUEST_20161005_004559	Every night, I dream of running away from a rampaging tree.{nl}I'm just watching as my husband runs to save other people.

QUEST_20161005_004564	Beyond Pilgrim's Way is the Great Cathedral, which was built by Maven. {nl}Ruklys, Lydia Schaffen, and Agailla Flurry were all his disciples.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004565	The Great Cathedral was significantly damaged on Medzio Diena, so I wonder if people {nl}still go there. Back then, a great number of people would go there to do various rituals.
QUEST_20161005_004566	The base forms of all things are water, earth, wind, and fire, {nl}and these are controlled by the goddesses.

QUEST_20161005_004572	Recent findings by the Vaivora have been alarming historians.{nl}There had always been a sort of unspoken consensus on the fact that Ruklys was innocent, unlike what is believed by the masses, by those who knew all the facts about the incident.{nl}However, we can see from the documents that this can now be confirmed.
QUEST_20161005_004573	#VALUE!
QUEST_20161005_004574	{nl}As the truth has been revealed, we feel that it is only right that the heroes are recognized once more and that the misconceptions spread among the masses should be altered.{nl}Even if you take into account that the aftermath of Medzio Diena is still being felt.{nl}Written by Pyromancer Master Abreh Melinn on Year 1096 of our Kingdom.

QUEST_20161005_004687	Grasp the time at which you are granted audience with the King.{nl}The guardian will appear as the King looks down upon your last light.
QUEST_20161005_004688	Now let's try to make sense of this with the words written on the stone slate.{nl}It seems as if the King is signified by the statue in the center.
QUEST_20161005_004689	{nl}If so, do you think that the twelve pillars on either side represent when you meet the King?{nl}Does it mean that you should touch the pillars?
QUEST_20161005_004690	{nl}I think we'll have to activate the pillars and statue in the correct order.
QUEST_20161005_004691	There seems to be a switch within the pillar.{nl}Do you wish to activate it?
QUEST_20161005_004692	I was in the middle of activating this switch...{nl}Do you think I should move to another pillar?
QUEST_20161005_004693	It simply says that you must prove you are of royal blood to the guardian.
QUEST_20161005_004694	{nl}It seems as if simply touching it doesn't have an effect.{nl}We should take another look at the slate.
QUEST_20161005_004695	You have finally arrived at Taniel the Second's Royal Mausoleum!
QUEST_20161005_004696	{nl}I feel as if I am finally being rewarded for our efforts...{nl}I wouldn't have been able to come this far without your help.
QUEST_20161005_004697	{nl}I don't know how to repay you.{nl}I am sure that General Lhamin will be pleased as well.
QUEST_20161005_004698	The Ashaq Underground Prison is the only remaining prison out of several built in the south part of King Kadumel's kingdom.{nl}Despite its connection to Ruklys Civil War and King Kadumel's tyranny, the building remains to this day as it was maintained through the years for various purposes other than a prison.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004699	 I'll start repairing the Teleportation Magic Circle
QUEST_20161005_004700	You only seem to be able to notice the strangly shaped sculpture among the Kupoles.
QUEST_20161005_004701	You cannot seem to figure out where it is used.
QUEST_20161005_004702	You feel an energy that is sufficatingly evil.{nl}Try finding Kupoles first.
QUEST_20161005_004703	You feel as if holy power is embracing you.
QUEST_20161005_004704	Savior. It feels as if the protection magic has been removed.{nl}You should go and recieve it again before going on.
QUEST_20161005_004705	I will disarm the barrier.
QUEST_20161005_004706	That is...{nl}Siute must have been turned by darkness!
QUEST_20161005_004707	{nl}Just as I had worried...{nl}That's why there was no answer!{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004708	We should at least subdue Siute.{nl}Please stand back!
QUEST_20161005_004709	We can barely tie Siute down.{nl}Please gather the other Kupoles.
QUEST_20161005_004710	You have a feeling that it will be too late if you go and gather the other Kupoles.{nl}Could there be something you can do?
QUEST_20161005_004711	Now.{nl}Please use your energy!
QUEST_20161005_004712	Goddess Dalia
QUEST_20161005_004713	Ah... I feel the presence of Laima in you.{nl}Thank you, Savior.{nl}You have purified the darkness within me with your divine energy.
QUEST_20161005_004714	{nl}We don't have a lot of time.{nl}The carving on my arm is already emitting evil energies again...
QUEST_20161005_004715	This carving is Giltine's curse.{nl}I am getting evil energies that are in contrast to my own powers.
QUEST_20161005_004716	{nl}I cannot retain my conscious when Giltine's energy fills my body.{nl}I only destroy everything in front of me with the power of chaos.
QUEST_20161005_004717	{nl}This is why I had been held here...{nl}I am feeling the evil energies fill me once more.
QUEST_20161005_004718	{nl}Please go before I can't control myself.
QUEST_20161005_004719	600 years ago, a demon had cursed this city with petrification.{nl}The people here turned to stone, including their souls.
QUEST_20161005_004720	{nl}I tried to save the city.{nl}But the demon was adament.
QUEST_20161005_004721	{nl}He said that he didn't harm either the bodies or souls of the humans.{nl}Therefore, I shouldn't be able to interfere.
QUEST_20161005_004722	{nl}Neither a goddess or a demon is allowed to interfere with humans as long as they don't harm them...{nl}That was our deal.
QUEST_20161005_004723	The demons captured me and put the curse on me with Giltine's powers.{nl}I started destroying the forests after being consumed by the power of chaos.
QUEST_20161005_004724	{nl}Only the Demon Goddess is able to control the power of chaos.{nl}My sisters made another agreement with the Demon Kings.
QUEST_20161005_004725	{nl}We agreed to give up on the petrified city...{nl}In return for myself being sealed here by Gesti, Kartas and Vaiga.
QUEST_20161005_004726	{nl}After sealing me here, they gave control of this cave to my sisters.{nl}The Kupoles have been guarding it ever since then.
QUEST_20161005_004727	It is unlikely that they would have hidden Dalia somewhere this obvious.
QUEST_20161005_004728	This seems to be a portal being used by the demons.
QUEST_20161005_004729	I'll infuse the divine energy from the Zolem Core after purifying it...{nl}Medena, please give me strength.
QUEST_20161005_004730	You demons!{nl}These are the demons that kidnapped Goddess Dalia!{nl}We will be able to pinpoint her location if we read their minds.
QUEST_20161005_004731	{nl}We can't know where District 5 is from the information we already have.{nl}I'll have to absorb their souls and read their minds that way.
QUEST_20161005_004732	{nl}Serija said that it is dangerous but...{nl}You can save me if I am consumed by darkness.{nl}We'll have to do our best before giving up.
QUEST_20161005_004733	He will soon arrive. Do not let the Kupole or Revelator enter District 5 before he arrives.
QUEST_20161005_004734	This world will be consumed by chaos when he arrives and frees the insane goddess.
QUEST_20161005_004735	I hope this will purify everything...
QUEST_20161005_004736	Dalia does not seem to be here.
QUEST_20161005_004737	A stronger force is blocking you. It is not possible to go further.
QUEST_20161005_004738	Ah... This... This feeling...
QUEST_20161005_004739	{nl}It was you...
QUEST_20161005_004740	{nl}Gesti...!
QUEST_20161005_004741	It's been a long time Dalia.
QUEST_20161005_004742	I can't believe that my minions weren't even capable of stopping maggots like these...{nl}I am embarrassed that I trusted those worthless minions.
QUEST_20161005_004743	{nl}Wait... You...
QUEST_20161005_004744	{nl}Ha, I never thought we'd be able to meet again so quickly.{nl}I hope you haven't forgotten what happened at Tenet Church?
QUEST_20161005_004745	I didn't know that we would meet here...
QUEST_20161005_004746	I was looking forward to getting my revenge for Tenet Church...
QUEST_20161005_004747	You wait right there you naive Revelator!
QUEST_20161005_004748	{nl}Dalia, I will free you.{nl}Go and destroy whatever you meet with the power of Giltine!
QUEST_20161005_004749	{nl}The Tree will become stronger with all that destruction.{nl}I shall give my life for that to happen!
QUEST_20161005_004750	Guardian Kupoles of the cave... {nl}Please answer my call...
QUEST_20161005_004751	How could this be!{nl}Has... has the curse been removed?{nl}This can't be...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004752	Gesti.{nl}You shall kneel in front of the power of the Goddesses.
QUEST_20161005_004753	I... Do you think that I'll simply kneel before you?!
QUEST_20161005_004754	Savior... I shall focus all of my power into the Divine Orb.{nl}Please defend me from Gesti while I do so.
QUEST_20161005_004755	The Revelator was no match for me even though it wasn't for lack of trying...
QUEST_20161005_004756	{nl}Dalia, it seems that you've merely regained temporary consciousness.{nl}I will continue to bathe you in the Giltine's energy until you succumb!
QUEST_20161005_004757	{nl}I won't stop until you have lost all sense of self and are entirely consumed!
QUEST_20161005_004758	Gesti...{nl}Bow before the power of your owner.
QUEST_20161005_004759	Wh...What?!{nl}How can you use the powers of Giltine!
QUEST_20161005_004760	Kupoles...{nl}Go back to your locations.
QUEST_20161005_004761	This is my last order.{nl}Please honor it.
QUEST_20161005_004762	Thank you Medena.{nl}You have gone through much in order to protect me thus far.
QUEST_20161005_004763	{nl}You even managed to call a Savior...{nl}Laima must have forseen all of this.
QUEST_20161005_004764	Savior, I thank you.{nl}I was able to undo some of my previous wrongdoings thanks to your efforts in purifying the chaos that surrounded me.
QUEST_20161005_004765	{nl}However, this is not the end of the adventure.{nl}You are destined for much greater deeds than this in the future...
QUEST_20161005_004766	{nl}So please, leave Gesti to me.
QUEST_20161005_004767	Just listen to you talking nonsense.
QUEST_20161005_004768	Gesti...Do you remember what you told me earlier...
QUEST_20161005_004769	{nl}You said that you would gladly give your life...
QUEST_20161005_004770	{nl}All preparations are complete.{nl}You shall die with me here.
QUEST_20161005_004771	It seems as if the demons are growing even more violent.
QUEST_20161005_004772	I hope the Goddess is still safe...{nl}I really do...
QUEST_20161005_004773	I can't believe that the Kupoles have become so weakened...
QUEST_20161005_004774	Even Serija has been captured by the demons...
QUEST_20161005_004775	I do at least feel a bit better now that I have seen her.
QUEST_20161005_004776	We have finally arrived at the place where Goddess Dalia is.{nl}I hope she is okay...
QUEST_20161005_004777	Even the Kupoles have trouble meeting Dalia without protection magic.
QUEST_20161005_004778	The demons have kidnapped Goddess Dalia!{nl}I saw them with my own two eyes!{nl}There were three of them!
QUEST_20161005_004779	Serija... She is wounded...{nl}We need to find her!{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004780	Goddess Dalia seems to have regained consciousness... I haven't seen her like this for a long time...
QUEST_20161005_004781	It sounds like the screams of Serija!{nl}Something must have happened!
QUEST_20161005_004782	Please tell me as soon as you are prepared.
QUEST_20161005_004783	Leave the lower levels to the Tala Tribe.
QUEST_20161005_004784	Now, the day of total destruction will come upon us.
QUEST_20161005_004785	We demons will free the goddess from her seal.
QUEST_20161005_004786	We shall take the goddess.
QUEST_20161005_004787	You must not allow humans or Kupoles to come to District 5 where the goddess is.
QUEST_20161005_004788	This voice... Medena... it's Medena.{nl}Are you nearby?
QUEST_20161005_004789	Savior...{nl}Savior, I have a favor to ask of you.{nl}This will most likely become my last request...
QUEST_20161005_004790	{nl}Please lead the Kupoles as far away from the Tevhrin Stalactite Cave as you can...{nl}There is not much time left.{nl}I will lose consciousness soon...
QUEST_20161005_004791	Soon, a great evil will arrive at the Tevhrin Stalactite Cave.{nl}Considering the strength of the energy... Kartas... or Gesti...
QUEST_20161005_004792	{nl}Whomever it may be, one of the demon lords are coming towards Tevhrin Stalactite Cave.{nl}I will soon be consumed by the power of chaos at this rate.
QUEST_20161005_004793	{nl}Then they will free me from the seal.{nl}What happens next will be... death and destruction...
QUEST_20161005_004794	{nl}So please... Go as far away as possible.{nl}Far enough away so that I will not be able to find you...
QUEST_20161005_004795	Ah... That...
QUEST_20161005_004796	{nl}Saule... an divine orb with Saule's powers...{nl}Perhaps that will be good enough...
QUEST_20161005_004797	{nl}If I can use my powers along with the divine orb with Saule's powers, I will be able to face the Demon Kings.{nl}However, I will have to maintain consciousness while resisting the power of chaos.
QUEST_20161005_004798	{nl}The curse is solidifying it's grasp on me once more.{nl}The many evil statues that the demons installed here and there while I was kidnapped...
QUEST_20161005_004799	{nl}They are adding even more energy to the power of the curse.{nl}I will prepare for the battle with the Demon Kings.
QUEST_20161005_004800	{nl}So please destroy the statues for me.{nl}This will allow me to be able to resist the power of chaos until I fight the Demon Kings...
QUEST_20161005_004801	The monsters here will have seen the demons hide the goddess.
QUEST_20161005_004802	I thought so... The Tala Tribe knew about the whereabouts of the goddess.
QUEST_20161005_004803	The Demon Kings... Do you think we'll have the power to face them?
QUEST_20161005_004804	Divine power this strong...{nl}It isn't any weaker than the energy of the Demon Kings I felt earlier!
QUEST_20161005_004805	There is no time to lose.{nl}The magical core should be enough to open the road.{nl}Let's go!{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004806	Goddess Dalia... Do you hear me?
QUEST_20161005_004807	Do you think this will end with my death?{nl}That is pathetic.
QUEST_20161005_004808	{nl}Kartas will tear your souls apart.{nl}You will regret not dying at my hands!
QUEST_20161005_004809	It's lucky that we at least found the demon's portal now.
QUEST_20161005_004810	The road has opened!{nl}Let's go to District 2 of Tevhrin Stalactite Cave!
QUEST_20161005_004811	Revelator...{nl}You and I have such a long and tenuous relationship!
QUEST_20161005_004812	{nl}I will end you for good this time!
QUEST_20161005_004813	Only a soul remains shining where Dalia stood.
QUEST_20161005_004814	Savior, you will save Dalia and Tevhrin Stalactite Cave.{nl}Just like Dalia's prophecy.
QUEST_20161005_004815	Good luck.
QUEST_20161005_004816	Who are you?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004817	Do you have business here?
QUEST_20161005_004818	You cannot seem to find Lina.{nl}It seems as if she has gone to install supplements elsewhere.
QUEST_20161005_004819	You should try organizing what you have heard.
QUEST_20161005_004820	What are your thoughts on the leaves you've seen?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004821	You think that it was balanced due to the struggle between the two of us?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004822	I had never thought about that...
QUEST_20161005_004823	Balance...{nl}That makes sense.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004824	Although I did ruin Lina's work, I never stopped her from doing anything.{nl}I always interrupted her work after she started it.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004825	Maybe it was just the right timing to stop anything from dying?
QUEST_20161005_004826	I thought that we were causing trouble for the refugees.{nl}Whatever the case, we fought in front of the humans even when we should have been adhering to the will of the Goddesses.
QUEST_20161005_004827	{nl}However, I thought that protecting the forest was the way to protect the refugees here.
QUEST_20161005_004828	There doesn't seem to be anything special about the leaves even if their colors are quite vibrant.
QUEST_20161005_004829	You cannot see the growth rings outside of the stump.
QUEST_20161005_004830	You have already checked this stump.
QUEST_20161005_004831	What happened to the forest...{nl}I'm glad that the vegetation isn't overgrowing anymore but...
QUEST_20161005_004832	I am worried since there are less herbs for us to use...{nl}There are herbs that can only be gathered during autum, but each herb has it's own use.
QUEST_20161005_004833	Of course, it's beneficial in the short term since we have more wood to fell.{nl}However, there will be no more trees at this rate.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004834	Trees don't grow during autum you see.
QUEST_20161005_004835	I wonder when I'll be able to get the report I requested...{nl}I have to report to the Chronomancer Master after reading it.
QUEST_20161005_004836	Thank you so much for helping.{nl}I was able to finish the experiments much faster thanks to your help.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004837	Now I will be able to help the Chronomancer Master find a solution to solve this region's problems.
QUEST_20161005_004838	There doesn't seem to be anything here
QUEST_20161005_004839	It seems that you have collected another page.{nl}This... You seem to be able to make out what is written on it. Take it to Kostas?
QUEST_20161005_004840	The leaves aren't falling even when the trees are shaking.
QUEST_20161005_004841	Here, take this.{nl}I was able to finish it quickly thanks to your help.
QUEST_20161005_004842	You'll be able to find nearby objects with divine energy by using this.
QUEST_20161005_004843	What was on the written orders?
QUEST_20161005_004844	What happened to the investigation?{nl}We have to find it before the demons do...
QUEST_20161005_004845	I see you've safely retrieved the third clue!{nl}Thank you!{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004846	Did you say that you've managed to get the new orders??{nl}Let's see...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004847	I think it's only a bit different from the previous one.{nl}It says that it should be retrieved from Diena instead of Gesti.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004848	What do you think happened? The orders to retrieve them from different demons...
QUEST_20161005_004849	Are you saying that they are having an arguement between themselves?{nl}A demon that has issues with Gesti...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004850	Demon lord Diena is one of the four commanders of Gesti.{nl}I can't believe that she'd argue with Gesti...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004851	What do you think could have happened?{nl}Do you think this has anything to do with it?
QUEST_20161005_004852	Diena
QUEST_20161005_004853	You...?
QUEST_20161005_004854	{nl}Ah, you must be the Revelator that has been interrupting our work here.{nl}I trust you'll understand if I don't wish to greet you.
QUEST_20161005_004855	{nl}If you are trying to find traces of Ausrine here, you're too late.{nl}Where are the traces that you've taken?{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004856	I... I need them.{nl}Hand them over.
QUEST_20161005_004857	Me?{nl}What am I doing here?
QUEST_20161005_004858	{nl}You...{nl}The Revelator?
QUEST_20161005_004859	{nl}Ah... I remember a little now.{nl}I was born a fairy and lived protecting humans...
QUEST_20161005_004860	{nl}The last memory as a fairy was of Gesti appearing in front of me before Medzio Diena.{nl}I became a Demon Lord and... I wish that I had no recollection... 
QUEST_20161005_004861	{nl}There must have been a trace of my old self within me...{nl}Maybe this was Gesti's curse...
QUEST_20161005_004862	{nl}I wanted to go back to my life as a fairy...{nl}I required the power of Ausrine to do that...
QUEST_20161005_004863	{nl}That's why I tried to gather all of the traces before they went into Gesti's hands...{nl}However, I shall give you these traces.
QUEST_20161005_004864	{nl}Somebody is coming.{nl}Take these while I have a bit of my former self.
QUEST_20161005_004865	{nl}I do not require them any more...
QUEST_20161005_004866	Ugh, you again.{nl}I want to start attacking you at once when I think of our last meeting...{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004867	But I've come to do some cleaning up you see.{nl}I wont forget what I've suffered at Zachariel's Royal Mausoleum.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004868	You shall die to my powers one day.
QUEST_20161005_004869	I've told Deadborn as well, but bring the traces to me before sending them to Gesti.
QUEST_20161005_004870	Who is the commander here?{nl}I told you to bring them to me.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004871	I won't say this again.{nl}I am ordering you to bring the traces to me.
QUEST_20161005_004872	Dullahan, I seem to recall giving you orders to bring Ausrine's traces to me.
QUEST_20161005_004873	This is my final warning.{nl}Hand over the traces.
QUEST_20161005_004874	There is only an orb without any trace of the messenger.{nl}What could have happened to him?
QUEST_20161005_004875	Do you wish to use the raft?
QUEST_20161005_004876	The orb is blinking faintly.
QUEST_20161005_004877	The orb is shining.

QUEST_20161005_004880	This is from before there was a large statue in Fedimian.{nl}Of course, there was a small statue even then.
QUEST_20161005_004881	In any case, the fact that one could lose money by dropping it on Fedimian soil {nl}has made Fedimians very careful in handling their money.
QUEST_20161005_004882	 Modestas admitted defeat and said he'd pay him pay back. As he was leaving the place with wagon in tow, the old alchemist broke into a strange smile that caught Modestas' attention.
QUEST_20161005_004883	 Unbelievably, the piece of lead turned into gold in front of Modestas after a flash of suspicious light.
QUEST_20161005_004884	 Modestas knew these gambles were more than just about money. {nl}Modestas, a dedicated gambler, nodded along with the woman's words. He clearly looked to be a man with a huge burden, his facial expression dark. {nl}The old woman could sense Modestas' thoughts, so she made this proposal.
QUEST_20161005_004885	[Since you seem to be worrying about how to move this boulder, what about this?{nl}I usually don't change the deal, but I'll make a special offer to add some fun.{nl}How about seeing if I can move this boulder on to your cart?{nl}You'll be able to receive help moving the boulder even if you lose the bet.]{nl}Modestas nodded in agreement since the deal seemed fair.{nl}However, the old woman started talking as soon as she saw him nod.
QUEST_20161005_004886	When Modestas asked about the condition, the old woman answered.{nl}'You are to take the boulder, which I will load onto the wagon, to Klaipeda. Then, turn it into an object of value which everyone will recognize and esteem. If you are successful, then the punishment for losing the bet against me will become void. Your friends will not disappear. Although this is difficult, I will still give you one more chance since you've already lost the bet. How about it?'{nl}Like always, Modestas had no choice.
QUEST_20161005_004887	The moment Modestas agreed to the proposal, the old woman pointed her finger past him. {nl}Modestas turned around and to his surprise, the boulder he had trouble with was effortlessly placed on the wagon. By the time Modestas looked forward again, the old woman had already disappeared. {nl}
QUEST_20161005_004888	Because Modestas had no ropes or equipment to secure the boulder onto the wagon, he had to lean the wagon and carefully drive it to Klaipeda. {nl}On his way to Klaipeda, he again met the soldiers who he had earlier bet against. Their commanding officer was now aware of what had happened thus far, and wanted to apologize to Modestas for getting him caught up and hurt in his subordinates' affairs. {nl}
QUEST_20161005_004889	The officer offered him help as soon as he heard that Modestas would be moving the boulder to Klaipeda.{nl}The officer and his men secured the boulder with strong ropes to prevent it from falling off and said that he would accompany him to Klaipeda.{nl}Modestas thanked the soldiers and accepted their offer. 
QUEST_20161005_004890	Modestas met the alchemist on the way to Klaipeda.{nl}He gave the gold bar since a promise was a promise.{nl}The alchemist started talking to Modestas as he seemed surprised by the fact that Modestas gave the gold bar without any resistance.
QUEST_20161005_004891	Everyone listened to them talking since they where curious about the bet.{nl}That's how they started talking about how they got involved with Modestas. The alchemist became sorry for fooling Modestas.
QUEST_20161005_004892	That's why he told Modestas that he would make arrangements to help him when he got to Klaipeda.{nl}Modestas was able to take the boulder to the center of Klaipeda and set the boulder down in the Central Plaza.
QUEST_20161005_004893	Just as the boulder was set down by the soldiers, the alchemist came with someone.{nl}The person that came with the alchemist was the famous sculpture and Dievdirbys Tesla.{nl}The alchemest started talking.
QUEST_20161005_004894	[How about sculpting a Goddess Statue with this boulder in the center of Klaipeda. I think that everyone in Klaipeda will recognize it's value if the boulder becomes a Goddess Statue. If so, I think that the conditions between yourself and the old woman will be met.]{nl}Everyone there agreed that this would be a good idea.
QUEST_20161005_004895	As news spread, everyone in Klaipeda was pleased to know a Goddess Statue was planned for their city. {nl}However, one last problem remained, asides from winning their favor. And that question was, which goddess should the statue commemorate? {nl}The soldiers who gave help transporting the boulder were especially passionate about this issue, and began quarrelling again. {nl}
QUEST_20161005_004896	The person to solve this problem was none other than Modestas.{nl}He thought that even if he didn't set out to do so, he should try to organize things as he was raising a Goddess Statue in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}He realized that the Goddess had appeared in front of him in the form of an old woman and tried to let the other people know of this fact.{nl}The people decided to believe Modestas and the Goddess Statue was allowed to be made.
QUEST_20161005_004897	When the Goddess Statue was finally complete, the people of Klaipeda were curious to see which Goddess would stand in the center of their beloved city.{nl}However, they were alarmed to see that they could not recognize who the Goddess was. 
QUEST_20161005_004898	The Dievdirbys who had sculpted the statue had already vanished deep into the Kateen Forest, so the citizens of Klaipeda repeatedly questioned Modestas for her name. {nl}Despite the numerous questions, nobody received an answer from Modestas. {nl}At any rate, this is the story of how the Goddess Statue of Klaipeda came to be. Even now that statue stands in the center of Klaipeda.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004899	And so, some people believed Modestas, having undertaken the goddesses' intervention, was an honest man who did not gamble. In reality, Modestas didn't stop making gambles until his death. {nl}
QUEST_20161005_004900	Since that time, whenever Modestas took on a wager, he always bet the same thing. The answer to the question of who the Statue of Klaipeda honored.{nl}To uncover the name of the goddess, numerous people challenged Modestas to a bet.{nl}
QUEST_20161005_004901	However, Modestas didn't lose a bet even under the most dire circumstances. Therefore, many years passed without anyone learning the truth about the Goddess Statue.{nl}Modestas passed away undefeated, but never betting again after that incident.
QUEST_20161005_004902	People were finally able to learn that the Goddess Statue in Klaipeda was meant to be Goddess Ausrine.{nl}Goddess Ausrine took betting away from a man's life, but she also created a interesting mystery and a Goddess Statue in the middle of Klaipeda.

QUEST_20161005_004904	{s35}{nl}A Certain Alchemic Record (I){/}
QUEST_20161005_004905	 I write this, seeing so many people struggling with the path of an alchemist, to help those who will come after me shall learn the skill 'Magnum Opus.'{nl}First of all, transmuting one type of root into another. The instruction is as follows.{nl}{nl} 0 | 0 | 0 {nl} 0 | 0 {nl} 0 {nl}Following the instruction allows the user to transmute one type of root into another by placing it in the order. However, it does not apply to all types of roots.{/}
QUEST_20161005_004906	 Secondly, the transmutation of one type of shell into another. The process is slightly more complicated than the previous method. There are some that work well the other not so much.{nl}{nl} 0 | 0 | 0 {nl} 0 | x | 0 {nl} 0 | 0 | 0 {nl} Placing it in that order, it can transmute one type of shell into another.{/}
QUEST_20161005_004907	 The last procedure to be included in this part 1 is how to transmute one type of wing to another. The possibilities are wider than the previous two. Even I, the author of this book, cannot fully categorize them all. The procedure is like the following.{nl}{nl} 0 | x | x | 0 {nl} x | 0 | 0 {nl} 0 | x | x | 0 {nl}

QUEST_20161005_004913	I am certain that your courage and sacrifices will move the Goddesses' minds.
QUEST_20161005_004914	The Lolopanther and Solmiki Areas were named after animals that followed the Goddesses.{nl}I suppose it may be unfamiliar to humans that are not used to them.
QUEST_20161005_004915	The demons in the Solmiki Area are much more stronger.{nl}You will have to make preparations before we can go.
QUEST_20161005_004916	I had aided Goddess Zemyna before the demons took over the Earth Tower.{nl}However, I haven't been able to see the Goddess since then.{nl}I became weaker by the

QUEST_20161005_004934	However...{nl}After listening to Lhuta, it seems as if there is reason to rethink about your world.

QUEST_20161214_005013	The Demon-Goddess Treaty
QUEST_20161214_005014	A long time ago, the Creator ordained unto us our duty, and a disharmony of opposing ideas emerged.{nl}Countless eras have since passed.{nl}
QUEST_20161214_005015	Among the many conflicts of opinions, none was as fervent as the one concerning humanity.{nl}Ignoring the differences between both sides is sure to lead to a war.{nl}

QUEST_20161214_005017	We are beings born of the same roots.{nl}Yet, we have carried out our dispute for too long; this treaty is, sadly, the sole occasion in which we have reached an agreement.{nl}

QUEST_20161214_005019	We choose this, one of the paths where we first let humankind out from under the ground, as the venue of our pact.{nl}As we diverged most widely in our opinions on humanity, we find this to be an appropriate location.
QUEST_20161214_005020	With the enactment of this treaty, we aim for a cessation of our millennia-long dispute.{nl}Furthermore, we make known our wish for this to become the start of eternal peace.

QUEST_20161214_005038	Once you have the token, you can open the seal and obtain the key to the treaty.{nl}The key opens the box that contains the slate with the contents of the treaty.
QUEST_20161214_005039	If you have the key, now you need to find the slate with the treaty.{nl}Go to the Yudejan Altar and find the box that opens with the key; you'll find the treaty slate inside.

QUEST_20161214_005047	{nl}I put it next to a book called History of the Rebellion; make sure to read it.{nl}Or you could read both books and compare them, that should be fun.

QUEST_20161214_005049	No idea how it started.{nl}Everyone's all hush-hush, no one wants to talk to an outsider like me, I guess.
QUEST_20161214_005050	{nl}The way they're whispering though, I couldn't help but hear it even if I didn't want to.{nl}They're saying someone appeared and saved Orsha from some sort of danger.
QUEST_20161214_005051	{nl}I wonder if it was something like Medzio Diena?
QUEST_20161214_005052	You are very kind.{nl}I'm sure the person who saved the Bishop of Orsha not long ago was just as kind as you.

QUEST_20161214_005054	{nl}She may not be able to tell you in person, but the Lord of Orsha is extremely grateful for all you've done.

QUEST_20161214_005056	{nl}But you're welcome to speak to her about any problem if you wish.
QUEST_20161214_005057	Heard ya took care of Evoniphon, huh?{nl}You did what I should've done myself... Guess I should thank you.
QUEST_20161214_005058	{nl}Then again, it's a bit of a letdown.{nl}Not trying to dismiss what you did, don't get me wrong.

QUEST_20161214_005070	With the stamina weakening, it doesn't seem like it's going to get any worse.
QUEST_20161214_005071	After touching the water... some stamina was released!
QUEST_20161214_005072	It's probably wiser not to touch this.
QUEST_20161214_005073	Is this even okay to eat...? Well, too late.

QUEST_20161214_005088	She's like the Sun in the sky.{nl}If the sunlight is too strong or too weak we can't grow crops, you see.
QUEST_20161214_005089	{nl}So Goddess Saule is the one to please if you want a good harvest.{nl}Looking at the way the world has become these days, I would say Her power is not as strong anymore.

QUEST_20161214_005097	{nl}If you don't like it, give it to another hungry person.
QUEST_20161214_005098	That potato bread is going to go stale soon if no one eats it.{nl}With all the hungry people in the world...
QUEST_20161214_005099	{nl}I guess it's not enough food to share with the people coming back from destroyed cities.

QUEST_20161214_005105	I lost my daughter and wife during Medzio Diena... I don't want to live anymore but I'm hungry.{nl}How did I end up like this...
QUEST_20161214_005106	Potato bread... Yeah, I used to make a lot.{nl}I was trying to make dumplings but I failed every time, so they turned into hard bread instead.
QUEST_20161214_005107	{nl}My wife would always tease me about my potato bread.{nl}It was tough, but it tasted okay, she said... Our daughter and us, eating potato bread... We were happy then.
QUEST_20161214_005108	{nl}Those days will never be back now...{nl}That's what Medzio Diena did to us.{nl}It took away our dreams and our hope.
QUEST_20161214_005109	{nl}It's none of those goddess stories the higher-ups keep feeding us every time.{nl}To me, it was the day my hope, and my family, were lost.

QUEST_20161214_005121	Should I send you to Jack over there instead?
QUEST_20161214_005122	Guard Dan sent you here from the other side?{nl}Well isn't he helpful...
QUEST_20161214_005123	{nl}As you can see, there's nothing here.{nl}And you're going to fall if you're not careful, so I suggest you get back down.

QUEST_20161214_005139	The thing is, didn't they say this curse was because of that revolt 600 years ago?{nl}But I thought it was proven that it wasn't a revolt at all, wasn't it?

QUEST_20170313_005503	{nl}Anyway, if you keep carrying them around like that, they'll be hard to read later on when you need them.{nl}Let me have a look.
QUEST_20170313_005504	Isn't it much better having these records made into a proper book?{nl}I took special care with the binding, so make sure you use them well.

QUEST_20170313_005520	Varkis told me to watch out for that man.
QUEST_20170313_005521	Varkis left a record behind when he died.

QUEST_20170313_005523	Earthly attachment isn't letting me go back to the goddess, I guess.{nl}Why did you call?
QUEST_20170313_005524	{nl}That man...?{nl}Oh, I don't know, my memory is fuzzy.{nl}Probably because I died.

QUEST_20170313_005535	{nl}-The 4th of X {nl} - {nl} There's been very little traffic coming to town from the capital. {nl} When one family moved in, the whole village threw a welcome party. {nl} After all, how many outsiders do we get to meet these days? {nl}
QUEST_20170313_005536	The 10th of X {nl} - {nl} Mr. Raman, who lived at the bank of the creek opposite from us, went on leave. His wife said he was off to get firewood. {nl} Well, for a long time he was gone in Klaipeda. {nl}I've heard that you can find a lot of beautiful girls in Klaipeda. {nl}
QUEST_20170313_005537	The 16th of X {nl} - {nl} I got a stomachache drinking soup that I didn't know already went bad. {nl} I double-checked the smell before eating it, but there was no bad odor. {nl}I felt horrible inside so I went to the well for water. Even with the water, I continued to feel horrible. {nl}
QUEST_20170313_005538	I've been throwing up a lot lately but it seems to be getting better now. {nl}Tomorrow I'm going to go see Mr. Gordon to get some medicinal herbs. {nl} My little sister still hasn't come back yet. When I go to her room, I find no clothes. Even Mr. Raman is getting worried.
QUEST_20170313_005539	The 17th of X {nl} - {nl} The village was eerily quiet today. {nl}There are no signs of the people who went earlier to get herbs from Mr. Gordon.{nl}{nl}The 23rd of X {nl} - {nl} This might be the last time I get to write in this diary. {nl} Lyliana, you are the only family I have left in this world... {nl} Please be alive somewhere... {nl}
QUEST_20170313_005540	I was just about to go gather a few more materials before heading to Orsha.{nl}Oh, but...
QUEST_20170313_005541	{nl}What are those notes you're carrying?{nl}They look a bit... damaged.
QUEST_20170313_005542	{nl}They're going to rip and fall off if you keep carrying them like that.{nl}I do have a few leather strings that are a little too short to use on scriptures...
QUEST_20170313_005543	Since you were so kind to find me leather string and paper for my scriptures, this time I'm repaying the favor.{nl}Here you go.
QUEST_20170313_005544	{nl}This should keep your notes from ripping apart.
QUEST_20170313_005545	Are you taking good care of that... diary, was it?{nl}The one I binded for you.{nl}I can't wait to see the day where all my scriptures are also completed.
QUEST_20170313_005546	That book, though... it says Andale Village... What is it?{nl}That's the village where I used to live...
QUEST_20170313_005547	This is... my brother's diary...{nl}...
QUEST_20170313_005548	{nl}He was so happy that a new family moved in...
QUEST_20170313_005549	{nl}But then... the village... and my brother...

QUEST_20170313_005551	{nl}You can ask any questions you want later... Just not now...
QUEST_20170313_005552	... I just don't want to talk... Not right now...
QUEST_20170313_005553	Our headman said Andale was one of seven villages founded a long time ago.{nl}The region is said to have been found by a hunter who got lost. In this region, people built a beautiful shrine along with the seven villages.
QUEST_20170313_005554	{nl}The villages shared a stream of clear water that turned the moss and the trees into beautiful colors...{nl}But one elder in Andale Village was suspicious of this color-changing water.
QUEST_20170313_005555	{nl}The people of Andale did not drink from the stream and gathered their water from a well.{nl}Meanwhile, all the other villages drank the stream water for a long time.
QUEST_20170313_005556	{nl}The water from the stream, however, wasn't fit for drinking.{nl}One by one, people from the other villages started to fall ill.
QUEST_20170313_005557	{nl}In the end, out of the seven villages, six became impossible to live in and were abandoned.{nl}I guess these villages were all but forgotten... and Andale, too, was no longer sought by outsiders.
QUEST_20170313_005558	{nl}Now... I'm guessing Andale Village is also deserted...{nl}From what I heard after coming here, this was all a curse by Demon Goddess Giltine.{nl}
QUEST_20170313_005559	That new family that moved in...{nl}I actually never saw them.
QUEST_20170313_005560	{nl}My brother was too excited about having outsiders around and did visit them once or twice.{nl}Oh, now that I think of it... Wow...
QUEST_20170313_005561	{nl}Every time we made a ceremony to the goddesses, they always said they were sick and never came.{nl}Why did I not notice it then...?
QUEST_20170313_005562	{nl}The truth is, if that day I hadn't fought with my brother and left the village, the same thing would have happened to me...
QUEST_20170313_005563	My brother was a good person.{nl}He was a talented cook and, even when we short on food, he liked sharing his dishes with the neighbors.
QUEST_20170313_005564	{nl}The whole reason we fought that day was because he wanted to make porridge for the neighbors with the last few potatoes we had...
QUEST_20170313_005565	{nl}Our neighbor, Mr. Raman, was always praising my brother.{nl}He must be gone now, too... Taken by those demons...
QUEST_20170313_005566	Dusty Objects
QUEST_20170313_005567	A pile of dusty abandoned objects.{nl}Have a look?
QUEST_20170313_005568	There's an old bowl with water.
QUEST_20170313_005569	It's only dust.
QUEST_20170313_005570	Guess there isn't much to find other than this bowl.
QUEST_20170313_005571	I bet this is nothing.
QUEST_20170313_005572	This looks like it will be dangerous to tamper with.
QUEST_20170313_005573	Nothing interesting to see here.
QUEST_20170313_005574	Smokey Spot
QUEST_20170313_005575	Should I throw away the water from before here?
QUEST_20170313_005576	Nothing changed.
QUEST_20170313_005577	Oh...
QUEST_20170313_005578	{nl}Now that I think about it...
QUEST_20170313_005579	{nl}You're back.{nl}Is there anything else you want to know?
QUEST_20170313_005580	A long time ago, goddesses and demons made an agreement that they would not interfere with each other.{nl}One of the conditions of this pact was that demons were not allowed to murder humans.
QUEST_20170313_005581	{nl}Then, 600 years ago, Gesti placed a curse in the Roxona region.{nl}She did so under the pretext that it was in response to Ruklys' rebellion.
QUEST_20170313_005582	{nl}Goddess Dalia stood forward to help those in Roxona.{nl}The petrified city with the forgotten name...
QUEST_20170313_005583	{nl}Then, the demons appeared and brought up the agreement.{nl}They claimed that the victims had not been murdered, merely petrified, and attacked Goddess Dalia.{nl}That is how she became trapped in the curse of the demon goddess.
QUEST_20170313_005584	{nl}The curse imparted in Goddess Dalia clashed with her own divine force, forming something immensely more powerful.{nl}This left Dalia in the state you know Her as...
QUEST_20170313_005585	{nl}That is why the entire area was burned to the ground...{nl}There was nothing that could bring the goddess back to her own conscience...
QUEST_20170313_005586	{nl}So the three Demon Kings imprisoned Dalia, and the Kupoles were left to watch over Her.{nl}No other goddesses dared to interfere with the petrified city after that.
QUEST_20170313_005587	{nl}Some might criticize the goddesses for their lack of action when they hear about this.{nl}But I believe it was a reasonable choice to make at the time.
QUEST_20170313_005588	Oh no...{nl}But then, who would frame someone like that?
QUEST_20170313_005589	{nl}And why...?
QUEST_20170313_005590	The secret could have been hidden in Ruklys' memorial.{nl}The truth about the real hero who took the blame at the time, that is...
QUEST_20170313_005591	Why would Premier Eminent think of doing something like that?{nl}I ought to investigate further.
QUEST_20170313_005592	It won't be easy now that the contents of the memorial are gone.{nl}I wonder if there isn't a way to recover them...
QUEST_20170313_005593	Glad to see you again.{nl}What's the occasion?
QUEST_20170313_005594	So Ruklys was not a traitor?{nl}That means that rubbed copy was still useful...
QUEST_20170313_005595	I can get some more charcoal and make a new copy of Lydia Schaffen's tombstone.{nl}Should be able to read it then, right?
QUEST_20170313_005596	{nl}We might even get some insight into her history, don't you think?
QUEST_20170313_005597	{nl}It's still a relief, you know?{nl}With the way the world is nowadays, some people never get to clean their own name.
QUEST_20170313_005598	{nl}At least some can still get their honor back.
QUEST_20170313_005599	{nl}Not sure if that's a blessing or a curse.
QUEST_20170313_005600	Explaining Owl
QUEST_20170313_005601	Hmm, it seems like you're still curious about something, are you?{nl}Are you interested in what's going to happen to the owls now?
QUEST_20170313_005602	I can't see much from where I stand, so I spent a lot of time on my own.{nl}I don't know if you humans are like this too, but spending time alone, thinking, makes us realize certain things.
QUEST_20170313_005603	{nl}Where we came from, things like that...
QUEST_20170313_005604	Maybe you realized those things through your journeys.{nl}Us owls, you can say that we're signs of Tesla's immortality.

QUEST_20170420_005872	To take free will away from humans is something even the goddesses condemn.{nl}But what the Monk Master Olfas Grimm has planned, whether right or wrong, is harmful to many people and can even kill them.{nl}That is what saddens me.
QUEST_20170420_005873	The Monk Master wants to train mercenary gladiators in secret and trade them to gain control of the capital's arena. Morally, I find this hard to condone.{nl}But it seems Olfas Grimm himself believes his deeds are justified for contributing to a greater good.
QUEST_20170420_005874	Monks are different from other Cleric faiths in that they pay service to the goddesses not through their relation to Them, but through self-training.{nl}However, by breaking his deal with the Corsair Master and refusing to pay, Grimm has disregarded even the values any good business person should have.{nl}Although I do agree that, as Monk Master, keeping a promise to a pirate would do nothing but harm.
QUEST_20170420_005875	Monks believe it is right to do not what the goddesses want, but what the goddesses need.{nl}For people like Olfas Grimm, their physical training only reinforces this belief, the idea that anything is justifiable if it is for the sake of the goddesses.{nl}It came as a surprise to everyone when, without hesitation, he broke the double contract he had signed with the Schwarzer Reiter and Doppelsoeldner Masters.
QUEST_20170420_005876	Nemoken borrowed a large sum from the Monk Master in order to lure assassin Evoniphon by pretending to hire him.{nl}In the end, she could neither catch Evoniphon not return the money.{nl}This was a chance for the Monk Master to find her weakness.{nl}He may have no plans to take advantage of this weakness yet, but he surely won't forget it after they are even.
QUEST_20170420_005877	It's true that Hayraven, the Corsair Master, has become kinder after Medzio Diena forced him to return to solid ground.{nl}But that does not excuse all the crimes he commited before that.
QUEST_20170420_005878	Hayraven was always most violent when attacking other pirate ships.{nl}Many were the times when he pillaged whole merchant vessels, and to rival pirates he was particularly cruel.{nl}He did not kill those whom he captured; instead he sent them over to the Monk Master, but he never received payment for it. You can see why Hayraven isn't very fond of Olfas Grimm now.
QUEST_20170420_005879	In a way, Hayraven is someone in charge of his own destiny.{nl}In the eyes of the goddesses, he is no more important than the Great Pirate Vladslovas whom he killed.{nl}Ultimately, he turned fate in his favor out of sheer will.{nl}And perhaps a little help from his cunning nature...
QUEST_20170420_005880	Had Jurate, goddess of the sea, been a little more interested in the lives of humans, the sea would have been peaceful, with or without the royal navy.{nl}When She did come into contact with humans again, Hayraven was already on land after losing his ship.{nl}It was all due to Medzio Diena.
QUEST_20170420_005881	The only reason why the Corsair Master is not preparing to return to the sea now that the royal navy is weakened, is that there aren't as many ships sailing anymore.{nl}It may sound contradictory, but him going back to the sea would be a sign of the Kingdom returning to normal life.
QUEST_20170420_005882	Before Medzio Diena, the Corsair Master came across a few of the Doppelsoeldner Master's soldiers at sea and destroyed their ship.{nl}Guerra, the Doppelsoeldner Master, has hated him since.{nl}Both Masters aren't the type to shy away from one-on-one confrontations, but neither do they tend to get involved in anything that isn't profitable.{nl}It's hard to even say who would win if they were ever to face each other.
QUEST_20170420_005883	After Olfas Grimm broke his contract with the Doppelsoeldner Master and embezzled the money, he's been searching for legal ways to take revenge on the Monk Master.{nl}He would not be satisfied with merely having him killed.
QUEST_20170420_005884	As leaders of mercenary groups, the Doppelsoeldner and Schwarzer Reiter Masters haven't always been on good terms.{nl}But after the contract misadventure with the Monk Master, his grudge became only deeper.
QUEST_20170420_005885	Unlike the Schwarzer Reiter Master, Guerra values his group's reputation, authority, and most of all, profits.{nl}He believes these factors to be crucial when it comes to increasing their combat power and strategic expertise.
QUEST_20170420_005886	Guerra is not, in fact, the Doppelsoeldner Master's birth name.{nl}Many assume that, by adopting a new name, he was either attempting to disguise his noble ancestry due to his activities as a mercenary leader, or the opposite, his low-class origins.{nl}I do know the truth about his heritage, but I mustn't reveal a personal secret.
QUEST_20170420_005887	Warsis, the Schwarzer Reiter Master, originally descends from a family of commoners.{nl}He adopted his surname from subordinates and enemies who, astounded by his competence, gave him the nickname of Creak.
QUEST_20170420_005888	Unlike the Doppelsoeldner Master and his mercenaries, the Schwarzer Reiter Master is more akin to a war aficionado.{nl}He promotes comradeship among his mercenaries, with all profits earned benefiting both him and his subordinates.{nl}An ideal troupe to him is one of talented warriors joined together by deep comradeship and strict military discipline.
QUEST_20170420_005889	Upon learning about what happened to the subordinates he had taken over from the Monk Master, the Schwarzer Reiter Master was as furious as if he had been personally attacked himself.{nl}Since this incident, Warsis Creak despises the Monk Master, but also Hayraven and the Doppelsoeldner Master, due to what he considers a dishonest management of mercenaries.
QUEST_20170420_005890	Warsis Creak, the Schwarzer Reiter Master, is a prime figure in the military field.{nl}He is a man of astounding combat prowess and strategic technique, but also of considerable social and cultural refinement.{nl}The reason he hasn't applied for the royal army is that he believes he would be unable to experiment with and master diverse types of weapons and techniques.
QUEST_20170420_005891	As a leader with fairly liberal views, the Schwarzer Reiter Master will not hesitate to introduce new guns or other weapons to his group of mercenaries.{nl}Because of this, he is considered to be the most decent Master among the four who run mercenary troupes.
QUEST_20170420_005892	Rashua, the Swordsman Master, had dedicated his entire life to military service.{nl}Now, he merely tries to bear with the agony of witnessing the misery that has struck the kingdom.
QUEST_20170420_005893	Maria Leed, the Peltasta Master, believes that taking part in combat should earn anyone proper compensation.{nl}But most of all, to her, going to battle is a question of honor.{nl}It's one of the reasons why she remains so impassive to the Highlander Master's persuasion.
QUEST_20170420_005894	Highlander Master Douglas Black is a courteous, dignified man, as much so as the residence he inherited from the distinguished family of which he descends.
QUEST_20170420_005895	I still feel like I am in debt to Walder Junnot, the Barbarian Master, for never having had the time to really help his family.
QUEST_20170420_005896	I strongly believe we will one day live in a peaceful world where Hoplite Master Aidas Valor and his partner Flyntess can raise a family.
QUEST_20170420_005897	Kamiya, the Rodelero Master, is an outstanding soldier, but he isn't sure which army he ought to serve.{nl}I try not to interfere and instead respect his decisions.
QUEST_20170420_005898	Memet Culag, the Cataphract Master, forwent marriage to follow his own path.{nl}He may have no descendants to carry his name, but his achievements certainly will.
QUEST_20170420_005899	Justina Legwyn, the Squire Master, is the last descendant of her family. It's an unfortunate destiny, having to carry the responsibility of both those positions...
QUEST_20170420_005900	At her young age, Sorscha Hutton is already set to become the greatest Fencer Master to date.{nl}Anyone who dares to cross her path can only expect to face the cold blade of destiny.
QUEST_20170420_005901	Born to a family of commoners, Uska grew to become a general of the royal army, Knight Commander and Templar Master.{nl}His sword is respected wherever he goes, and he is as responsible as he is talented.
QUEST_20170420_005902	Valeska Himil, Dragoon Master and representative of the Himils, is set to have an important role in the future of her family.{nl}No one knows whether their spear will return to Schaffenstar or not, but  either way it's going to be a historic decision.
QUEST_20170420_005903	Shinobi Master Yura Swanjone works behind the scenes with the royal family, stealthily thwarting any forces that dare threaten the throne.
QUEST_20170420_005904	Phelixia, the Murmillo Master, does not shy away from putting her life on the line.{nl}With anything she does, however, she puts tremendous effort into making sure she is ahead and in charge of her destiny.
QUEST_20170420_005905	Noer Parecius, descendant of a great king! The throne may never belong to him, but his lance will certainly have him remembered as a king of war.
QUEST_20170420_005906	Centurion Master Krajicek is a role model to every member of the royal army.{nl}It's a shame that the current state of the army is hindering him.
QUEST_20170420_005907	I truly respect the Matador Master's outlook on life.{nl}It simply saddens me that her incredible talent and influence can be put to wrongful use in the world.
QUEST_20170420_005908	The Wizard Master used to be considered the least gifted among the magic Masters.{nl}Her current skill, however, is no lesser than that of any talented Master.{nl}I admire her effort.
QUEST_20170420_005909	I admire the vision of Abreh Melinn for finding a new point of contact between Clerics and Wizards.{nl}Who else but her would be fit for the position of Pyromancer Master?
QUEST_20170420_005910	Cryomancer Master Aleister Crowley is a very clever man. He may be loyal, but he isn't innocent, and he won't hesitate to deceive others for his own benefit. That is all I have to say about him.
QUEST_20170420_005911	Behind the appearances, Ili Terid, the Psychokino Master, hides a fragile heart and a yearning to have his genius recognized.{nl}This despite him having developed powers before he learned about magic, and being recognized as an outstanding merchant even before his powers manifested.
QUEST_20170420_005912	Winona Ende, the Linker Master, is a genius of the kind that is rare to find even among the most notable figures in magic academia.{nl}In about 170 years, she may very well surpass legends like Lucid Winterspoon or Owyn Dilven.
QUEST_20170420_005913	Larisa will only live as much as the average human being.{nl}Ultimately that is what will keep her from fully developing her genius.
QUEST_20170420_005914	Wican Celestic, the Elementalist Master, is dreaming of a love that is unattainable.{nl}The woman he loves is solely interested in eternal life and does not care for marriage.
QUEST_20170420_005915	The Sorcerer Master may still be young, but she's very concerned about aging and death.{nl}I can't say whether she's going to become an Amzinas, however.{nl}The same is true for the Oracle Master, which could be one of the reasons why Dame Circe does not care for Apolonjia.
QUEST_20170420_005916	Lucid Winterspoon has lived for many centuries, never fully retreating into solitude nor actively stepping out into the world.{nl}I respect her free will, but I do think that, like time itself, to others she is merely a flowing presence.
QUEST_20170420_005917	Loretta Nimbus is the Necromancer Master and the youngest of the Amzinas. She's chasing after  a goal that's impossible to reach.

QUEST_20170420_005925	Rozalija, a Siaulai native, had always dreamed of becoming a healer.{nl}It was only after Medzio Diena that she came to follow the path of Cleric Master.{nl}One of the rare positive outcomes of that tragic day.

QUEST_20170420_005939	Taoists are a unique kind of clerics. They approach the divine not by worshiping the goddesses, but by understanding and cultivating human nature.{nl}As Taoist Master, Geuhong holds the records of all those who chose this path since times past.

QUEST_20171128_006825	The Zealot Order: Fervor and Devotion	질럿 교단의 광기와 열정				
QUEST_20171128_006826	The strong devotion that characterizes the Zealots does not currently tend to manifest itself in ways that contradict royal laws or secular standards.{nl}Historically, Zealots have accused demons as the main culprits for the disappearance of the goddesses.	그런 까닭인지 모르지만,{nl}질럿 교단의 광기와 열정은{nl}이단심판관도 왕국법도 간섭하지 않는 방향으로 표출되었다.{nl}라이마 여신의 행방이 묘연한{nl}이유는 확실히 모르지만, 질럿 교단은 역사적으로 그 혐의를 마족에게 두었다.				질럿 교단의 광기와 열정
QUEST_20171128_006827	In the past, this has lead Zealots to abduct a number of high-rank demons.{nl}The Zealots proceeded to torture the captured demons, interrogating them about the whereabouts of the goddesses as well as the demons' involvement in the incident.	따라서 질럿 교단은 힘 닿는 대로 고위 마족을 납치하여왔다.{nl}그리고 납치한 마족을 고문하여 그들이 라이마의 행방불명에 대해 알고 있는지 라이마의 실종과 마족이 어떤 관련이 있는지 그 증거를 밝히려 한 것이다.				질럿 교단의 광기와 열정
QUEST_20171128_006828	Their practices remained largely unknown by both the Kingdom and other cleric orders. Is it thought, however, that had they been exposed, the Zealots' cruel torture tactics would have received their fair share of criticism.	마족에 관한 일이기 때문에 왕국 정부나 다른 교단 등 누구도 신경 쓰지 않기는 했어도 이들이 마족을 고문하는 방법과 정도는 매우 잔혹하고 혹독한 것이어서 외부에 알려졌다면 설령 그 대상이 마족이라 하더라도 비난을 받았을지도 모른다.				질럿 교단의 광기와 열정
QUEST_20171128_006829	In the process of capturing and torturing high-rank demons, the Zealots also committed a number of unintended assassinations.{nl}In some cases, the demons were killed during the Zealots' attempts to abduct them. Unaware of the circumstances, a small section of the general public often supported these apparently calculated murders.	고위 마족을 납치하는 과정에서 의도한 바와 달리 실패할 경우 뜻하지 않은 고위 마족의 암살이 일어나기도 했다.{nl}외부에는 이것이 납치를 시도하다가 역량이 부족하여 죽이고 달아난 것인지 처음부터 목적이 암살이었는지 알 수 없었기 때문에 일부 대중들의 지지를 얻어낸 일도 있다.				질럿 교단의 광기와 열정
QUEST_20171128_006830	Despite the minimal support obtained, the Zealots continued to be seen mostly in a negative light, which only reinforced their distance from the general population.{nl}This was all despite the fact that their actions were serving the noble purpose or regaining contact with Goddess Jurate.	그러나 그러한 소소한 지지{nl}움직임에도 불구하고 질럿 교단의 행태는{nl}대부분 괴팍하고 외부와 격리된 그들만의{nl}것으로 근본적으로 친화력이 부족한 것이었다.{nl}무엇보다도 좋지 않았던 일은 질럿 교단이{nl}유라테 여신의 은총을 얻어 그녀와 재접촉하고자 하는 방식이었다.				질럿 교단의 광기와 열정
QUEST_20171128_006831	Unlike Goddess Jurate's Loremasters, the Zealots were determined to solve the problem in their own radical ways.{nl}The order believed that Goddess Jurate's lack of communication was due to the fishing industry and other human intrusions to Her realm.{nl}This lead to Zealots attempting to sabotage not only fishermen, but also the royal navy, pirate crews and any human with a connection to the sea.	유라테 여신의 전승자들과 달리 질럿 교단은 그들 특유의 강경하고 완고한 입장으로 이 문제를 풀려 했다.{nl}질럿 교단이 유라테 여신이 인간과 교류하지 않는 것은 인간이 어업과 항해 등 여러 일로 유라테 여신의 영역을 침범하고 그녀의 평온과{nl}안식을 깨뜨렸기 때문이라고 생각하고 어민이나 상선은 물론 심지어 왕국의 해군이나 무법자들인 해적들의 일에 까지 끼어들어 바다에 관한 인간의 일이라면 무엇이든 훼방을 놓곤 하였다.				질럿 교단의 광기와 열정
QUEST_20171128_006832	Although the Zealots were never entirely wrong in their interpretation of Goddess Jurate's desires, their dubious methods and refusal to adopt a more moderate stance made them generally disliked by the public.	질럿 교단이 유라테 여신의 태도에 관해 내린 진단은 많이 틀리지 않았지만, 그 처방은 매우 잘못된 것인데도 그들이 오랜 세월 이런 태도를 유지하였기 때문에 사람들은 질럿 교단에 대해 좋은 감정을 품을 수 없었다.				질럿 교단의 광기와 열정
QUEST_20171128_006833	In light of these events, the Kingdom was forced to place several legal restrictions on the Zealots' activities, which contributed to a reduced public opposition to the order, although some aversion remained.	사실 위에 적은 왕국법과 여러 제약 사항들이 질럿 교단이 더 강력하게 행동하지 못하도록 하는 규제로 작용했기 때문에 사람들 역시 불만은 있지만, 적극적으로 질럿 교단에 대들지 않았다고도 볼 수 있다.				질럿 교단의 광기와 열정
QUEST_20171128_006834	Despite their undisputed devotion, to this day Zealots have been unable to establish themselves as a leading religious order among other clerics due to their extreme, single-minded approach to faith.{nl}It is because of this trait, however, that the order has managed to continue their activities in the Kingdom throughout the eras.	여하간 질럿 교단은 겉으로 보든지 내부의 일을 자세히 들여다 보든지 외골수에 고집스런 열정 혹은 나아가 광신적인 분위기 때문에 그들의 강렬한 신앙심에도 불구하고 여신의 신도들 사이에 강력한 교단이 되거나 주도적인 신앙세력으로 성장하지 못하였다.{nl}그러나 바로 그런 면 때문에 수세기{nl}동안 왕국에서 그 활동과 명맥을 이어올 수 있었다.				질럿 교단의 광기와 열정
QUEST_20171128_006835	Extracted from paper by Inquisitor apprentice Thomas Iconostasis, year 1021 of the Kingdom	‘왕국력 1021년, 수습 인퀴지터 토마스 이코노스타시스의 논문에서 발췌’				질럿 교단의 광기와 열정

QUEST_20171128_006837	{s33}{nl}Zealots: A History{/}	{s33}{nl}질럿 교단의 역사{/}				질럿 교단의 역사
QUEST_20171128_006838	Religious sects can be classified according to two factors: the goddess they serve, and how they serve divinity.{nl}In this aspect, our Zealot order is a rather particular case.	왕국의 교단과 종파는 두 가지 기준으로 분류된다.{nl}하나는 따르는 여신, 다른 하나는 섬기는 방식이다.{nl}그 중에서도 우리 질럿 교단은 매우 특이하다.				질럿 교단의 역사
QUEST_20171128_006839	Our order was founded on the desire to take a stronger stance on the then-recent disappearance of the goddesses.{nl}Since the order's early days, our objective has been not to worship the goddesses, but to find Them and return them to humanity.{nl}Should the day come when all the goddesses have been found and their positions restored, it is uncertain what the role of the Zealots will become.{nl}It will be the duty of the future Zealot Master as well as the order's to follow the wishes of the goddesses regarding this matter.	우리는 오래 전 여신을 잃은 교단이 강경노선을 채택하면서 시작되었다.{nl}이후 우리 교단의 목적은 여신 숭배가 아니라 여신 탐색으로 변경되었고, 이후 변하지 않았다.{nl}따라서 우리가 만약 잃어버린 여신을 인류에게 돌려주면 우리는 다른 잃은 여신을 찾는 탐색을 다시 시작할 것이다.{nl}그러나 아직까지 그런 일은 일어나지 않았기 때문에 훗날 우리가 진정 모든 잃은 여신을 찾아 더 이상{nl}찾을 여신이 없어지면, 우리 교단이 어떤 방향으로 나갈지는 미지수이다.{nl}또한 당연히 그것은 미래의 질럿 마스터와 교단원들이 여신들의 뜻을 받들어 결정할 문제이다.				질럿 교단의 역사
QUEST_20171128_006840	Throughout the history of the Kingdom, three goddesses ??Laima, Jurate and Dahlia ??are known to have disappeared or lost their connection with humanity.{nl}A majority of the Zealot order is concerned with finding Laima and Jurate, although members devoted to Dahlia do exist.{nl}Zealots who dedicate their work to reestablishing contact with Jurate have sharply disassociated themselves from the goddess' Loremasters, of which only a few members remain.{nl}The general perception that Jurate Zealots feel superior to or even ignore Her Loremasters is therefore not entirely wrong.	각설하고 왕국의 역사에서 행적이 묘연하거나 인간들과 단절함으로써 잃어버린 여신의 범주에 들게 된 여신은 세 명인데, 라이마와 유라테 그리고 달리아 여신께서 그에 속한다.{nl}우리 질럿 교단은 이 중 라이마와 유라테를 되찾으려는 세력이 주축을 이루고 있으며 소수지만 달리아 여신을 탐색하려는 교단원도 존재한다.{nl}이 중 유라테 여신과 재접촉하려는 우리 교단원들은 이제는 얼마 남지 않은 소수의 유라테의 전승자들과는 확연히 구별되며, 또한 외부에서는 우리가 유라테의 전승자들을 무시한다고 말하곤 한다.{nl}이 말은 어느정도 사실이기는 하다.				질럿 교단의 역사
QUEST_20171128_006841	Historically, the Zealot order has been unable to find support and popularity with the general public.{nl}The Zealots' limited personnel and poor financial stability has led to multiple internal conflicts over the recipients of the order's efforts.{nl}The very nature of the Zealot order, with requires extraordinarily strong will and determination from its members, has more than once been the cause of intense disagreements within the group.	우리 질럿 교단은 잃어버린 여신을 탐색하는 특성상 대중적인 인기와{nl}지원을 얻지 못해왔다.{nl}따라서 교단은 인원수와 재정 등이 취약하며, 이렇게 한정된 역량을 어느 여신의 탐색에 둘지를 놓고 교단 내에서 의견 대립이 있어왔다.{nl}우리 교단원들은 열정을 바탕으로 다른 성직자와 신자들이 관심 갖지 않는 힘겨운 영역에 몰두하는 사람들만으로 구성되어 있기에 그렇게 집착이 강한 성격상 그러한 교단내의 분쟁은 때로 도를 넘는 싸움으로 번진 적도 없지 않다는 점을 밝혀둔다.				질럿 교단의 역사
QUEST_20171128_006842	One of such disagreements ultimately brought about the division of our order into two factions around the Kingdom's millennium. Surprisingly, the order was reunified 30 years later with a marriage between the leaders of both factions.{nl}Their daughter is Aliza Tal, the current Zealot Master and representative, in charge of maintaining the order's unity into the next era.{nl}Many expect Tal's term as Zealot Master to consolidate a new direction for the order, one that will ensure a bright future for Zealots after a new Master eventually takes the position.{nl}This is a particularly sensitive issue for Zealots, with the impending generation shift from the supporters of Tal's parents to their own succeeding members of the order.{nl}Ultimately, then, the success of the Zealot order unification will depend on how Aliza Tal approaches her duty as Master, guided by the legacy of her parents.	부끄러운 이야기지만, 그러다가 결국 왕국의 천년제를 즈음하여 기어이 교단은 둘로 분열되었으나 다행히 훗날 다음 세대에서 양측의 대표였던 두 남녀가 결혼하면서 분열은 30년 정도 만에 일단 봉합되었다.{nl}현재는 이 두 분의 따님인 앨리자 탈님을 교단의 대표이자 질럿 마스터로 추대하는데 전교단이 동의하는 것으로 다음 세대에도 일단 교단의 통합을 이어갈 수 있게 되었다.{nl}그러나 현 질럿 마스터 앨리자 탈님의 시대에 진정한 화합의 계기를 마련하거나 교단이 새롭게 나아갈{nl}방향을 정하지 못한다면 다음 대에는 설령 앨리자 탈님의 혈통이 질럿 마스터를 계승하여도 교단의 장래는 어둡다고 할 수 있다.{nl}앨리자 탈님의 부모를 생각해준 교단원들도 다음 계승 때는 세대 교체가 이루어질 것이기 때문이다.{nl}그러므로 앨리자 탈님 이후의 교단의 통합은 어느 정도는 부모의 후광을 받아 이루어진 그분의{nl}질럿 마스터 취임과 달리 그분이 자리에 있는 동안 자신의 임무를 온전히 자신의 힘으로 얼마나 잘 수행하느냐에 달려있다.				질럿 교단의 역사
QUEST_20171128_006843	Fortunately for the order, Aliza Tal has demonstrated excellent conduct in her term as Zealot Master, earning the trust of not only Zealots but other clerics as well.{nl}One could say that, as an order specialized in the search of absent divinity, now more than ever the Zealots possess a relative advantage to other cleric groups that may very well contribute to their growing status in society. 	다행히 앨리자 탈님의 역량이{nl}훌륭하여 교단원들의 신망을 얻고 다른 성직자들에게서도 인정을 받고 있는 추세이다.{nl}한편으로는 모순적이지만 현재{nl}다른 모든 여신들이 실종된 상태라는 점도 본래 그런 상태에 익숙한{nl}우리 질럿 교단이 다른 성직자와 교단 종파들에 대해 비교우위를 가질 수 있는 불행 중 다행인 환경이라는 점도 도움이 되고 있다. 				질럿 교단의 역사
QUEST_20171128_006844	Zealots and Divine Power	질럿 교단과 여신의 신성력				
QUEST_20171128_006845	{s31}{nl}Zealots and Divine Power{/}	{s31}{nl}질럿 교단과 여신의 신성력{/}				질럿 교단과 여신의 신성력
QUEST_20171128_006846	Like their history and personality, the Zealots' views on divinity are characteristically different from those of other clerics.{nl}Unlike cleric orders which approach and use the divine power of the goddesses through prayer or ceremonies, Zealots, who are devoted to searching for the missing goddesses, rely on no divine figure from which to borrow their power.	그 특이한 성격과 남다른 역사와 마찬가지로 질럿이 여신의 신성력을 대하고 그것을 이용하는{nl}방식은 다른 성직자와는 전혀 다른 특징을 나타낸다.{nl}사실 그럴 수밖에 없는 점이 있다.{nl}다른 성직자들이 기도든 의식이든 어떤 방법으로든 여신의 신성력에 닿은 다음 그 권능을 빌려 사용한다고 본다면 잃어버린 여신을 따르는 교단인 질럿은 근본적으로 그런 신성력을 빌려올 대상 여신이 존재하지 않는다.				질럿 교단과 여신의 신성력
QUEST_20171128_006847	As the affiliation to multiple religious sects is not forbidden under the Kingdom's law, Zealots are allowed to use the power of other goddesses to pursue their activities.{nl}This, however, is a rare occurrence, given the Zealots' strongly independent and determined religious mindset.	물론 동시에 둘 이상의 교단에 속하는 일이 왕국에서 금지된 일이 아니므로 다른 여신을 섬기며 그 힘을 사용하여 그들 교단의 목표인 실종 여신 회복을 추구하는 일도 가능하지만,{nl}질럿 교단의 고집스런 태도와 독립적인 성향을 고려하면 그런 일은 완전히 사례가 없지는 않으나 매우 드문 일이었다는 점은 굳이 말하지 않아도 알 수 있는 일이다.				질럿 교단과 여신의 신성력
QUEST_20171128_006848	One method the Zealots have found to circumvent this limitation was to create their own kind of self-sacrificial rite.{nl}The very designation of this method may sound daunting but, to put it simply, Zealots do this by sacrificing their life energy and similar forces to invoke a new power.	이러한 이유로 질럿 교단이 성직자로서의 능력을 사용하는 우회로로 택한 방법이 일종의 자기 희생적 제사이다.{nl}비록 신학적인 복잡한 단어로 치장하기는 했지만, 간단히 말하면 자신의 생명력이나 그에 버금가는 무엇을 희생하여 일시적으로 본래 없던 힘을 불러내는 것이다.				질럿 교단과 여신의 신성력
QUEST_20171128_006849	As such, although unable to directly use the power of the goddesses, the Zealots' rites allow them to make use of a universal divine power connected to that of the goddesses, or the inherent divine force of the world itself.	이것은 비록 그들이 잃어버린 여신의 추종자이자 탐색자로서 직접적으로 여신의 신성력을 빌려오지는 못하더라도 넓은 의미에서 여신들의 총체적인 신성력 혹은 세상에 흩어져 작용하고 있는 여신의 보편적 신성력을 활용하는 행위이다.				질럿 교단과 여신의 신성력
QUEST_20171128_006850	Sensing and utilizing this universal divine power are abilities exclusive to those of the Zealot order. This is often presented by Zealots as definitive proof that, despite their lack of direct communication with the goddesses, they remain a recognized cleric order in the eyes of the divinities.	물론 여신들의 보편적인 권능이 세상 가운데 보이지 않게 작용한다고 하여서 이것을 일반인들이 사용할 수 없다는 점은 분명하다.{nl}따라서 질럿이 이런 능력을 사용할 수 있다는 점은 그들이 구체적인 여신을 정해 그 권능을 빌려오지 못함에도 그들이 여신의 인정을 받는 성직자라는 사실은 분명하다는 증거이기도 하다.				질럿 교단과 여신의 신성력
QUEST_20171128_006851	On the other hand, the Zealots' methods of manifesting their abilities by sacrificing life energy and related components are, to this day, not generally accepted among the public or other cleric orders.	그러나 그러한 신학적인 확증과 근거와는 별도로 질럿 교단원들이{nl}자신의 생명력이나 기타 그에 상응하는 자신의 일부를 희생하여 능력을 발휘한다는 점은 일반 대중은 물론이거니와 상당수의 동료 성직자들에게도 거부감을 일으켰다.				질럿 교단과 여신의 신성력
QUEST_20171128_006852	The Zealot order itself has shown no intentions of revising its practices, which seems to indicate that it will continue to stand by the uncompromising, self-segregating stance it is known for in the eras to come.	질럿 교단은 이러한 능력의 행사를 그만둘 생각이 없기 때문에 그들의 비타협적이고 친화력 없는 고립적인 상태는 이제까지 수세기 동안 그래왔던 것과 마찬가지로 앞으로도 그러하리라고 생각된다.				질럿 교단과 여신의 신성력

Time wasn't scarce according to Her premonition, but knowing the future was not enough to reassure Her. Not considering the opponent she was set to face.	비록 여신이라 할지라도 창조신께서 설정하신 우주적 법칙에서 자유롭지는 않았다.아니 오히려 대개의 경우 여신들은 그 법칙의 수호자이기에 더욱 그것에 종속된다고 볼 수 있었다.{nl}그러나 라이마는 아직 자신이 할 수 있는 일이 있다고 생각하여 정리를 서둘렀다.자신이 본 예지에 의하면 시간이 모자라지는 않지만,그녀의 상대가 상대인 만큼 미래를 본다고 안심할 수는 없었다.				라이마의 천년전 1권

QUEST_20171128_006897	Giltine stood in the abandoned home of Goddess Laima. A message, clearly directed to her, appeared briefly on the wall before fading back into nothing. Giltine meditated on the words. Unlike humans, she was unable to forget anything her eyes had seen.{nl}Her thoughts turned to words in her mind before she voiced them out, at once enraged and insulted.{nl}[So you left without even bothering to speak to me.

Kartas was chaos personified after all, there was no telling what he was capable of. Counting on his tenacious and uncontrolled nature, Giltine knew it was only a matter of time before he could find Her.	그녀가 내뱉은 신의 언어가 공기 중에서 사라질 때 뒤에서 기척이 들렸다.{nl}길티네는 자신의 명령에 따라 이곳에 온 세 명의 부하들을 찬찬히 살펴보았다.{nl}가장 왼쪽에 카르타스가 서있었다.그는 비쩍마르고 창백한 피부와 광기어린 눈동자를 빛내며 서있었다.{nl}이 자라면 라이마를 잡을 수 있을지 모른다고 길티네는 생각했다.미래를 내다보는 여신의 권능을 지닌 라이마를 추적하는 일은 길티네 자신에게도 어려운 일이었다.{nl}그러나 카르타스는 그 성격 자체가 혼돈이며 혼돈은 예측을 허용하지 않는다.{nl}카르타스의 집념과 그가 지닌 혼돈의 권능 그리고 특유의 광기가 만나면 라이마를 추격하여 잡는 일이 가능할지도 모른다.{nl}아니 시간이 걸릴 뿐 언젠가는 가능할 것이라고 길티네는 그렇게 생각했다.				라이마의 천년전 2권
QUEST_20171128_006900	On the other hand, Kartas hunted for pleasure and thoroughly enjoyed wreaking havoc. Laima would not die at the hands of Giltine's subordinate, but his destructive impulses seemed like too much of a risk.{nl}She erased from her mind the thought of entrusting Kartas with the goddess. Instead she turned to Vaiga, her most trustworthy subordinate. Vaiga was discreet, intelligent and powerful, a rare combination among Giltine's followers. Short of a true goddess herself, she knew not to expect perfection from her subordinates. Vaiga, however, would not disappoint her.{nl}Capturing a goddess with foreseeing powers would be no easy task. It could take centuries to find Her. And yet, to an immortal being it was not impossible, and Giltine was willing to bet on Vaiga to produce the right results.{nl}Unfortunately for her, there was a bigger, more urgent task reserved for Vaiga that she could not entrust to anyone else.	그러나 한편으로 카르타스는 살육을 재미로 하는 자이다.여신인 라이마가 카르타스에게 죽지는 않겠지만,라이마를 붙잡게 해준 카르타스의 혼돈의 속성이 라이마의 사망은 아니더라도 길티네가 예상치도 못했고, 원치 않는 다른 종류의 결과를 불러일으킬 수도 있었다.{nl}길티네는 카르타스에게 라이마의 추격을 맡기려는 생각을 마음에서 지웠다.{nl}다음으로 그녀의 지시를 기다리고 있는 마왕은 바이가였다.길티네의 모든 수하 가운데 가장 믿을 만한 자였다.길티네는 바이가에게 라이마의 추적을 맡긴다면 반드시 만족할 결과를 가져올 것이라 생각했다.신중함과 지성 그리고 강한 힘을 두루 갖춘 믿을 만한 부하는 길티네의 수하 중에서도 그리 많지 않았다.{nl}심지어 여신조차도 완전하지 않은데 그녀의 부하들에게 완벽함을 기대할 수는 없는 법이다.그렇지만 바이가라면 믿고 라이마의 추적을 맡길 수 있다.{nl}라이마의 예지 능력을 넘어 그녀를 포획하려면 몇 백 년이 걸릴 지 모르지만,그 정도의 세월은 불멸자에게 아무 것도 아니니 길티네는 곧 바이가로부터 결과를 보고 받을 수 있을 것이다.{nl}하지만 안타깝게도 길티네는 라이마의 추적보다 급한 다른 일이 있었고, 그것을 감당할 부하는 바이가 밖에 없었다.				라이마의 천년전 2권
QUEST_20171128_006901	 Conformed, Giltine turned her eyes away from Vaiga and onto her third demon.{nl}[Gesti, I want you to chase Laima. Do what you must to find her. I will not tolerate a failure.]{nl}Upon hearing Giltine's words, Vaiga acquiesced. Kartas clenched his teeth and growled loudly in discontent, gazing intently at his superior. Gesti stepped back on one foot, as if preparing for him to suddenly attack.{nl}Predictably, Kartas seemed fixed on the thought that he would have been chosen for the job if it weren't for Gesti. As someone who did not hesitate to defy Giltine herself, he was remarkably less keen on respecting her other subordinates as fellow demon lords.	 라이마의 추적은 어쩌면 다른 부하도 성공할지 모르는 임무이지만, 현재 그가 맡은 일은 다른 부하들에게 맡겨서는 성공할 가능성이 없었다.{nl}결국 길티네는 바이가에게서도 눈을 떼고 제스티를 돌아보며 말했다.[제스티, 라이마 추적의 임무를 네게 맡기겠다. 네가 할 수 있는 모든 것을 하라. 필요한 모든 것을 동원해도 좋으나 실패는 용서하지 않겠다.]{nl}이 말이 떨어지자 바이가는 그럴 줄 예상한 것처럼 조용히 납득했다는 의사 표시를 보였다. 반대로 카르타스는 즉시 전신으로 불만을 표출하며 이를 악물고 으르렁거리는 소리도 아니고 신음 소리도 아닌 괴상한 소리를 내며 길티네를 노려보았다.{nl}제스티는 카르타스가 갑자기 자기에게 덤빌 경우를 대비했다.{nl}카르타스라면 제스티가 없어지면 자신이 임무를 맡을지도 모른다는 단순한 생각으로 그러고도 남을 놈이었다.심지어 길티네에게도 저렇게 오만불손한 태도를 나타내는 녀석이니 바이가나 제스티가 같은 마왕이라고 존중할 것이란 기대는 하지 말아야 했다.				라이마의 천년전 2권
QUEST_20171128_006902	Giltine let out a deep sigh and adopted a rigid stance, glancing back at Kartas. A few moments passed before he looked away in defeat. As always, the only way to control Kartas was to overpower him into submission. Other than the goddesses, few were able to do that without collateral damage.{nl}	길티네는 속내로는 한숨을 쉬며 겉으로는 엄격한 태도로 카르타스를 마주 쏘아보았다.{nl}몇 초도 지나지 않아 카르타스의 기세가 수그러들었다.카르타스를 다스리는 방법은 더 강한 힘을 보여 누가 더 강자인지를 보여주는 방법 말고는 없었다.그리고 아무 피해 없이 그럴 수 있는 존재는 여신과 마신을 통틀어 몇 되지 않았다.{nl}				라이마의 천년전 2권
QUEST_20171128_006903	Now regretting ever having considered Kartas for the important task of finding Laima, Giltine adjusted her posture to speak again.{nl}[Kartas, you stay away from Gesti. You don't want to know what I'll do with you if I catch you out of line. You go to Gesti only if she asks for your help. Do as she says or you will be punished. I will not hesitate to take you down.]{nl}	길티네는 카르타스에게 라이마의 추적을 맡길 가능성을 잠시라도 하지 말았어야 한다고 생각하며 더욱 기세를 끌어올려 말했다.[카르타스 어떠한 경우라도 제스티의 행사에 끼어들지 마라. 그런 일이 생긴다면 다음 천 년을 내가 주는 시련을 받으며 지낼 것이다.{nl}또한 제스티가 도움을 요청하면 반드시 도와주어야 한다.그렇지 않으면 네가 취미로 살육이나 일삼는 행위를 못하도록 금지하겠다.]{nl}				라이마의 천년전 2권
QUEST_20171128_006904	Kartas slowly lowered his head, signaling to Giltine his obedience. No words were directed to Gesti.{nl}If needed, she would call for Kartas or his subordinates. He may not have been as brilliant as Vaiga, but Gesti was no fool either. She would be careful not to assign Kartas too big of a role, or push him to the point of releasing his explosive nature.	카르타스가 처음의 기세와 달리 고개를 숙이며 그 말을 따르겠다는 표시를 했다.제스티에게는 따로 이를 말이 없었다.{nl}제스티가 필요하다고 여기면 카르타스의 도움을 받거나 그의 부하들을 데려다 쓸 것이다.바이가 만큼 현명하진 않아도 제스티 역시 멍청하지 않으니 카르타스에게 무리한 요구를 하여 그의 성질을 폭발시킬 멍청한 행위를 하지는 않을 것이다.				라이마의 천년전 2권
QUEST_20171128_006905	 Gesti pondered on what task she could entrust to Kartas. Giltine stepped towards her, as if guessing her thoughts.{nl}[Let us leave, before the goddesses realize we came to find Laima.]{nl}Without further discussion, the four demons walked away from the scene, leaving Laima's home empty once again.	 제스티는 카르타스가 엉뚱한 일을 벌이지 않도록 뭔가 다른 일을 맡겨야겠다고 생각하였다.길티네는 그런 부하 마왕의 속을 아는지 모르는지 발걸음을 옮기며 말했다.[다른 여신들이 우리가 라이마의 거소에 있는 것을 알아차리기 전에 떠나도록 하자.]{nl}네 명의 존재가 발걸음을 옮기는 가운데 천천히 그 형상이 희미해지며 사라져가고 주인이 떠난 라이마의 거소는 다시 비어있는 장소가 되었다.				라이마의 천년전 2권

QUEST_20171128_006907	Gesti was certain Laima remained unaware of her plot. The goddess, on the other hand, had long predicted her actions, and was now more infuriated than ever with the demon's sheer audacity to follow through with them. Laima felt deceived. She felt as if Gesti was infringing the most basic of rules, even if no such rules existed for the demon.

She felt as if Gesti was infringing the most basic of rules, even if no such rules existed for the demon. That fact only added to Laima's bitter indignation.	제스티는 라이마가 승리를 위한 필수 조건에 인간이 포함된다는 핵심을 예지했다는 사실을 도저히 알 수 없었기에 그녀로서는 너무나 당연한 생각이었고,또한 너무나 어이없고 화가 나는 일이었다.{nl}사실 누구도 명확히 규정한 적이 없지만,그녀에게 라이마의 행동은 경기에서 반칙한 상대방을 보는 기분이었다.{nl}그런데 더 난감한 것은 사실은 그런 행위를 반칙이라고 명시한 규정은 어디에도 없다는 점이 더욱 화나는 일이었다.				라이마의 천년전 3권
QUEST_20171128_006910	Gesti was entirely uninterested in human politics: who the ruling dynasties were, how the Kingdom was founded, all of it. This was true even after she discovered that Laima had contacted with Zachariel, their founding king.{nl}The goddesses often communicated with their believers, the Kingdom's clerics, through prayer and apparitions. Gesti found this behavior unnecessary, though she was aware of the others' commitment to it.	제스티의 입장에서 인간의 왕조가 새로 성립하든 그 왕조의 개국시조가 누구며 무엇을 하든 전혀 관심사가 아니었다.그 개조라는 자카리엘이 라이마와 접촉한 사실을 알았을 때도 그 일을 대수롭게 생각하지 않았다.{nl}라이마가 아니라 다른 여신들도 그들을 따르는 인간의 신도가 성직자의 기도를 듣고 응답하며 가끔은 직접 그들에게 현신하기도 했다.제스티는 그것이 쓸데 없는 행위라고 여겼지만,그 행위 자체는 드문 일이 아니기에,라이마가 자카리엘이란 인간과 만난 일을 대수롭게 생각하지 않았던 것이다.				라이마의 천년전 3권
QUEST_20171128_006911	As Laima immediately met with Zachariel after escaping, Gesti merely saw it as a mundane visit rather than an act of despair.{nl}When she finally understood, the mortal king was already at rest in his tomb. With him, Laima had buried in the royal mausoleum a Revelation containing part of Her powers.{nl}Gesti hurried to the tomb when she realized it, but on arriving she discovered something even more unexpected. The mausoleum was protected by a defense system so sophisticated not even a powerful demon such as herself could ignore it.	자신을 피해 도피중인 라이미가 자카리엘을 만날 만큼 절박한 이유보다 평소에 인간을 하찮게 여기는 선입견이 더 크게 작용한 결과라고 할 수 있었다.{nl}그래서 제스티가 뭔가 알아차렸을 때는 자카리엘은 그 하루살이 같은 인간의 덧없는 수명을 다 소비하고 그가 생전에 만든 무덤에 들어가버린 후였다.그리고 라이마가 자신의 권능을 나눈 계시 역시 같이 소위 그 왕릉이란 곳에 묻히고 말았다.{nl}제스티가 그 사실을 알고 왕릉에 직접 들어가려 했을 때 그녀는 더 황당한 경험을 하게 되었다.왕릉은 제스티 같은 마왕도 무시할 수 없는 방비체계를 지니고 있었다.				라이마의 천년전 3권

She knew the goddess would continue to rely on humans to stop her, that She would find another way to make them work in Her favor.{nl}But Gesti was determined to carry out her task, through whatever means necessary.	자카리엘은 국왕의 권력을 총동원해 모든 자원과 마법을 동원하고 한편으로 성직자들을 움직여 여신의 신성력을 쏟아 부어 왕릉을 지키는 설비를 건설했다.{nl}오랜 세월이 지나면 왕릉의 설비가 노후화되고 약해지겠지만,지금으로서는 이곳을 뚫을 방법이 없다는 사실이 그녀를 더욱 화나게 만들었다.{nl}인정하기 싫지만 제스티는 자신이 라이마에게 초반에 한방 크게 당했다는 사실을 무시할 수 없었다.그리고 더욱 싫은 일은 라이마가 인간을 의지하는 일이 이번 한 번으로 끝나지 않을 것이란 점이었다.{nl}그녀는 다른 인간을 찾아 다시 같은 일을 할 것이었고,제스티는 그 사실이 더욱 불쾌했다.{nl}하지만 그렇다고 할 일을 하지 않을 수는 없었다.				라이마의 천년전 3권

Out of her own nine subordinates, she trusted him the most to infiltrate the mausoleum and retrieve the Revelation. If necessary, there were always other demon lords she could rely on for the task, she thought.	라이마가 인간을 이용한다면 그녀라고 다른 부하 마족들을 이용하지 못할 이유가 없었다.마족의 집단이 지닌 인간 무리 따위의 도움과는 차원이 다른 힘을 보여주겠다는 의중도 없지 않아 있었다.{nl}가장 먼저 그 소환에 의해 나타난 마군주는 렉시퍼였다.{nl}제스티는 자신이 부른 아홉 명의 마군주 가운데 이 왕릉의 설비들을 해제하거나 해체하고 계시를 획득할 자로서 렉시퍼가 가장 적합하다고 여겼다.{nl}필요하면 마군주를 더 부를 수도 있지만,일단은 아홉으로 시작할 생각이었다.				라이마의 천년전 3권

The young man was exceptionally well-mannered for someone of his noble status, which made him a widely respected figure among the people living in his father's lands.	약관의 한 젊은 청년이 집으로 돌아가고 있었다.{nl}길에서 마주치는 사람들은 그 청년이 그들을 다스리는 영주의 아들임을 알아보고 정중하게 인사를 하였고,청년은 사람들에게 부드러운 미소와 더불어 친절한 얼굴을 보이며 일일이 그 인사에 반응하였다.{nl}보통의 귀족과 달리 귀족의 예의는 있으면서 귀족들이 흔히 보여주는 거만함은 조금도 내비치지 않는 이 귀족가의 잘생긴 젊은이는 모든 영지민들의 사랑과 존경을 받고 있었다.				에미넌트 이야기1
QUEST_20171128_006918	He was particularly remembered for having saved multiple lives during an epidemic that had spread over the region the previous year. The disease took the lives of all his brothers and sisters, leaving only his ailing father and himself in the family. Most believed that, if it weren't for his son's devoted care and attention, the lord too would have perished from the epidemic. Assured by the young nobleman's selfless and respectful nature, the inhabitants of the land looked forward to the day he became his father's successor.	특히 작년에 영지를 휩쓴 전염병이 창궐하였을 때 자신의 몸을 돌보지 않고 영지민들을 도와 많은 사람들을 살렸다는 평가를 받고 있었으며,그 와중에 정작 부친을 제외하고 가문의 다른 형제자매들이 모두 죽어서 영지민들의 더욱 깊은 동정과 애정을 받게 되었다.{nl}영주의 저택에 드나드는 사람들의 말에 의하면 영주님도 가족을 잃은 탓인지 크게 몸이 쇠해 아프다고 하는데,이 아들의 헌신적인 보살핌이 아니었으면 벌써 돌아가셨을 것이란 것이 중론이었다.{nl}영주민들은 그들의 다음 대 영주가 될 사람이 훌륭한 품성의 젊은이라는 점에서 그의 치세를 고대하는 분위기가 대세였다.				에미넌트 이야기1
QUEST_20171128_006919	Now the sole descendant of the Eminent family, the young man carried his benevolent ways inside the residence, treating servants and guests alike with utmost kindness.{nl}One day, he carefully entered his father's room and dismissed the servants. The amicable smile soon disappeared from his features. He made sure they were out of hearing distance before drawing closer to the bed.{nl}[They know about my dedication and care now. More than enough, in fact. I think it's time for you to go.]{nl}The lord responded in a strained voice.{nl}[Why must you do this with our family...?]	이 에미넌트 가문의 살아있는 유일한 후계자인 젊은이는 자신의 저택에 돌아와서도 기품 있고 상냥한 태도를 잃지 않고 저택에서 일하는 모든 하인과 고용인들에게도 친절한 인사와 응대를 아끼지 않았다.{nl}그러나 그런 미소 어린 친절함은 그가 아버지의 방에 들어선 후 시중들던 하인을 내보낸 후에는 완전히 얼굴에서 사라졌다.{nl}청년은 아무도 듣는 사람이 없다는 것을 확신한 후 침대에 누운 아버지에게 다가가 말했다.[이제 충분히 내 지극한 간호를 주변에 알렸으니 그만 떠날 때가 된 것 같습니다.]{nl}그 말에 부친이 병색이 완연한 목소리로 힘겹게 물었다.[도대체 우리 가문에 왜 이런 짓을 하는 것이오?]				에미넌트 이야기1
QUEST_20171128_006920	The young man replied.{nl}[What do you mean? I'm going to bring true prosperity to your family, I'm going to make your name known. If anything, you should be thanking me for even having chosen you.]{nl}	청년이 대답했다.[이런 짓이라니요?나는 당신의 가문을 길이 번창시키고 세상에 명망을 드높여 줄 것이오.따지고 보면 당신은 내가 당신의 가문을 선택한 것을 고맙게 생각해야 합니다.]{nl}

[네가 내 아들딸들을 다 죽이고..]{nl}[아아, 그것은 어쩔 수 없는 일이었소.내가 본래 사람이 아니라 그저 이 청년의 모습을 빌린 존재라는 것을 알아차릴 가능성이 있는 사람들은 살려둘 수 없었으니까.그런 점에서 당신 역시 이제 그만 떠나는 것이 좋을 것 같소.당신의 영지와 작위를 물려받을 준비는 이제 다 끝났으니 말이오.]{nl}[내가 네 정체를 폭로할 수만 있다면…]				에미넌트 이야기1
QUEST_20171128_006921	[Please, stop trying. What is it that you want to reveal about my true identity? Other than me not being human, you know nothing.]{nl}[What are you?]{nl}[You will die soon, so I will not hide it. I am what you call a demon. A demon lord. I shall not reveal my true name. It is enough for you to know the name of Eminent, your family. When you die, there will be no more Eminents and no more unrest, no more disorder.]{nl}[Why are you after the lands and authority of a human?]{nl}[I have my reasons, but there is no need or time to elaborate.]{nl}Uttering these words, the young man reached out with his hand and lightly touched the other. He was still breathing slowly, his eyes closed. Later, with the servants back in the room tending to him, he would have his last breath. But not now.	[이미 그러려다 죄 없는 하인만 잡지 않았소.이제 그만 하시오.그리고 정체를 폭로하고 싶다지만,당신이 나에 대해 아는 것이 무엇이 있다고 폭로한단 말이오.사람이 아니라는 것을 제외하고 전혀 아는 바가 없지 않소?]{nl}[네 놈은 뭐냐?]{nl}[뭐 어차피 당신은 죽어가는 마당이니 굳이 숨기지 않겠소.나는 당신들이 흔히 말하는 마족이오.그것도 마군주라 존재지.나의 진명까지 알려주고 싶은 생각은 없소.지금은 일단 당신 가문인 에미넌트라는 이름이면 충분하겠군.이제 당신이 죽으면 다른 에미넌트도 없으니 혼동될 일도 없고 말이오.]{nl}[도대체 마군주라는 작자가 왜 인간의 작위와 영지를 노린다는 것이냐?]{nl}[거기에는 나름대로 사정이 있지만,더 이상 당신에게 이야기할 필요도 없고,시간도 없소이다.]{nl}그렇게 말하면서 청년은 손을 내밀어 상대를 가볍게 건드렸다.지금은 잠시 숨을 쉬며 정신을 잃은 상태지만,잠시 후에 사람을 부를 때 정도면 잠자는 도중에 여러 하인들이 지켜보는 가운데 자연스럽게 숨을 거둘 것이다.				에미넌트 이야기1
QUEST_20171128_006922	The man now set to become the only remaining member of the Eminent family took a few moments to organize his thoughts.{nl}After being tasked with finding Laima's Revelation and realizing the ways in which the goddess had used humans in Her favor, he was determined to plot his own scheme of human domination.	그 때까지 남은 시간 동안 이제 에미넌트 가문의 유일한 구성원이 될 청년은 자신의 생각을 다시 정리할 시간을 가질 수 있었다.{nl}제스티로부터 라이마와 그녀의 계시를 추격하는 임무를 받은 후,라이마가 인간을 이용한 계획을 세우고 그것을 실행한다는 사실을 알았을 때 그는 다른 마족과 달리 그 역시 인간을 이용할 계획을 세웠다.				에미넌트 이야기1
QUEST_20171128_006923	It would seem odd, that the ingenious Rexipher had wasted centuries surrounding that royal mausoleum before considering the thought of infiltrating the humans' society. On the other hand, the fact that he unlike other demons had even conceived such a plan was remarkable, given their proud and reluctant personality.{nl}He didn't know it yet, but his plan would become the foothold to, years later, defeating Laima's chosen guardian for the first time in history.	그렇게 똑똑하다는 렉시퍼가 겨우 인간의 왕이 남긴 무덤에 코를 박고 몇 백 년의 세월을 낭비하고 있는 모습을 보면서 어떤 마족도 인간과 그들의 사회를 이용할 생각을 하지 않는다는 점이 오히려 이상한 일이라 할 수 있었다.{nl}마족의 자존심과 성향상 생각하기 어려운 발상을 해냈다는 점에서 그는 다른 마족과 다른 점이 있는지도 몰랐다.{nl}이 때는 몰랐지만,그가 훗날 처음으로 라이마가 선택한 수호자를 궁지에 몰아넣고 죽인 최초의 마족이 되는 기반은 이 때부터 시작되었다고 할 수 있었다.				에미넌트 이야기1
QUEST_20171128_006924	Eminent Vol. 2	에미넌트 이야기2				
QUEST_20171128_006925	For the first time after Gesti discovered Laima's plans to hand Her Revelations over to posterity, the keeper of a Revelation had been murdered by a demon. Others had been sent by Gesti to complete that very mission, but Premier Eminent had been the first to succeed.	라이마가 인간을 이용해 자신의 계시를 후대에 전달한다는 계획을 알아차리고 제스티가 아홉 명의 마군주를 그 추적에 배치한 이래 처음으로 계시를 맡은 수호자가 마족에 의해 살해되었다.{nl}그 아홉 외에 그간 더 많은 마군주가 같은 명령을 받고 이 일에 나섰으나 그 가운데도 이런 성공을 거둔 자는 바로 그 프리미어 에미넌트가 처음이었다.				에미넌트 이야기2
QUEST_20171128_006926	As Lydia Schaffen's arrow burried itself into Ruklys' neck, Premier Eminent looked ready to shout out, 'I won!,' but he did not say a word.{nl}After disguising himself as a human and monopolizing the Kingdom's government from his political position, this was an important victory.{nl}His only grudge was failing to defeat Schaffen and Maven. Their names were far too powerful for him to attempt it without great risks.{nl}With Ruklys gone, all that was left to do was find the Revelation he was guarding. One word to poor King Kadumel was enough to grant Eminent full control over the operations.	프리미어 에미넌트는 리디아 샤펜의 화살이 루클리스의 숨통을 끊은 순간;이겼다’는 환성이 저절로 터져 나올 것 같았지만,실제로 소리를 내지는 않았다.{nl}인간의 모습을 위장하여 왕국의 재상이라는 지위까지 올라 국정을 농단한 끝에 얻은 귀한 승리였다.{nl}아쉬운 것은 당대의 수호자 가운데 리디아 샤펜과 메이번을 처리할 수 없었다는 점이다.{nl}그렇게 하기에는 두 사람의 명성이 너무 커서 무리수를 두지 않고는 가능하지 않았다.{nl}이제 루클리스가 죽었으니 그가 지키던 계시를 천천히 찾아내면 그만이다.{nl}멍청한 인간인 국왕 카듀멜은 몇 마디 하면 자신에게 모든 것을 맡기고 왕도로 돌아갈 테고,이곳의 모든 처결은 재상인 자신의 뜻대로 이룰 수 있다.				에미넌트 이야기2
QUEST_20171128_006927	He looked set to accomplish the enormous feat of becoming the first demon to seize Laima's Revelation.{nl}Suddenly, Lydia Schaffen made her way towards him. His human self was older than her, but he made the effort to address the acclaimed archer in his usual polite tone.{nl}[I was always sure you would be the one to capture the rebel leader. No general, no officer of the Kingdom but you, Lydia.]{nl}Lydia gave one look at the cunning politician before sighing deeply.{nl}[Next time you can believe I will be keeping my eyes on you. I don't care where you are or what you're doing, you won't be so safe anymore as long as I'm around. Mark my words.]{nl}Had another human spoken to him so brazenly, he would not have hesitated to retaliate. With Lydia, he merely maintained his unassuming expression of years trained in human interaction and spoke in a soft tone.{nl}[You are as proud as the one you killed today, I can tell. I should say, however, that one does not reach my position without a certain level of... competence.]	아직 누구도 성공하지 못한 라이마의 계시를 마족 중 최초 탈취하는 찬란한 공적은 온전히 그의 것이 되려 하고 있었다.{nl}그 때 리디아 샤펜이 다가왔다.{nl}에미넌트는 인간의 겉모습이 그녀보다 연상이고 지위 역시 재상이었지만,언제나 그러했듯이 주위의 보는 눈을 의식해 정중하게 이 인기 높은 여류궁수에게 예를 표하며 말했다.[반란의 수괴, 루클리스를 잡을 사람은 군문의 어떤 장군도 아닌 리디아님이 될 것이라고 생각하고 있었습니다.과연 제 예상이 틀리지 않았습니다.]{nl}리디아 샤펜은 아무 말 없이 이 노회한 정치가를 바라보다가 한숨을 쉬고 말했다.[이제 두 번 다시 내게 무얼 요구한다면,당신을 그냥 두지 않을 것입니다.당신이 어떤 곳에서 어떤 직위를 가진 존재이건 내가 결심했을 때 안전하지 않을 것입니다.]{nl}에미넌트는 다른 인간이 이런 불손한 말을 했다면 무척 기분이 나빴을 것이다. 인간의 모습으로 산 세월 동안 항상 유지하던 평정이 깨지지 않게 노력하면서 부드럽게 말했다.[당신도 당신이 방금 죽인 사형처럼 너무 자만심이 강합니다. 누구든 지금 저의 직위에 오른 사람은 결코 간단한 능력을 가지고 오를 수 없습니다.]				에미넌트 이야기2
QUEST_20171128_006928	Eminent and Schaffen peppered their words with the right amount of ambiguity. Their conversation was less and less a dialog between two humans. Lydia spoke next.{nl}[I knew a fool who used to say that... He's still up there, riding my arrow. I don't know if you know him.]{nl}It was true. No demon ??neither the fool she spoke of, nor the highest of demon lords ??had ever crossed her path and survived. Eminent found it hard to believe that would be his fate but, even with his immense power, Lydia was far from an easy target.	이 말을 하면서 에미넌트는 리디아와 마찬가지로 이중의 의미를 담았다. 이미 양쪽 모두 서로가 인간대인간으로 대화하는 것이 아니라는 분위기는 맞춰가고 있었다.{nl}리디아 샤펜이 말했다.[최근에 어떤 멍청이도 그런 비슷한 말을 하다가 지금도 내 화살 위에 올라탄 채 돌아오지 못하고 있는데 혹시 아는지 모르겠군요.]{nl}그 말은 사실이었다. 방금 리디아 샤펜이 언급한 그 멍청한 마족뿐 아니라 적지 않은 고위 마족들이 리디아 샤펜을 당하지 못하고 죽거나 소멸했다.{nl}에미넌트는 설마 자신이 그런 부류에 들어갈 허술한 자가 아니라고 생각했지만,이 여자는 그가 본신의 위력을 드러낸다고 해서 간단히 죽일 수 있는 그런 사람이 아니었다.				에미넌트 이야기2
QUEST_20171128_006929	Not only that, if there was any human capable of destroying a demon lord, the woman standing in front of him was certainly one of them. Her mentor Maven, on the other hand, was a high-ranked cleric who would stop at no means to defend himself from the demons.	현 시대에 지상에 살아있는 인간 가운데 마왕급의 마족을 죽일 수 있는 가능성이 있는 사람이 누구냐고 묻는다면,단 둘이라고 장담할 수 있었고 그 중 하나는 틀림없이 눈 앞에 있는 리디아 샤펜이었다.{nl}리디아의 스승인 메이번은 성직자로서 높은 경지에 도달해 있었지만,그라면 성격상 마왕에게서 본인을 지키며 퇴치할 수는 있어도 죽이기는 어려울 것임이 틀림없었다.				에미넌트 이야기2
QUEST_20171128_006930	Eminent decided not to respond to Lydia's provocation. In his human form of chancellor Eminent, he was in no way related to her sharp arrows.	에미넌트는 리디아 샤펜의 도발에 넘어가지 않았다.{nl}자신이 인간의 모습으로 재상의 직위를 유지하고 있는 이상,리디아 샤펜의 화살이 아무리 예리해도 그와는 무관한 일이었다.{nl}				에미넌트 이야기2
QUEST_20171128_006931	Lydia Schaffen's strategy, however, was not to fight physically.{nl}[Do you really think you'll get what you want now that Ruklys is dead? Have you forgotten that I was given the same divine task? If there was any chance of it getting to your hands, do you think he would have died at mine? Your plan will never work. You can be sure of that. But it's time for me to go now. Do me a favor when you deliver the news to His Majesty. Make sure everyone understands exactly what I did.]	그러나 리디아 샤펜은 에미넌트를 위해 촉이 달린 화살이 아니라 언어의 화살을 준비해 두고 있었다.[루클리스 사형이 죽었다고 당신이 원하는 것을 얻을 것이라 생각하나요?잊었는지 모르지만,나 역시 같은 임무를 여신으로부터 부여받은 사람이니 만의 하나라도 루클리스 사형의 죽음으로 당신이 그것을 획득할 가능성이 있다면{nl}내 손으로 그의 목숨을 거두지는 않았을 겁니다.당신이 어떤 다음 계획을 꾸미고 있었건 그것이 별로 소용없을 것이란 점을 확신합니다.그럼 나는 여기를 떠나겠습니다.왕에게는 당신이 잘 말해주길 바랍니다.그 인간 치사하게 감히 왕에게 인사도 없이 떠났다고 나한테 뭐라고 하지 않도록 말입니다.]				에미넌트 이야기2
QUEST_20171128_006932	Lydia Schaffen bowed and slowly walked away. Eminent wasn't too concerned yet. True despair wouldn't come for him until 10 days later.	리디아 샤펜은 그 말을 남기고 모자를 벗어 인사를 하고 자리를 떠났다. 에미넌트는 그 말을 듣고도 크게 염려하지 않았지만, 그로부터 열흘도 지나기 전에 절망감을 느껴야 했다.				에미넌트 이야기2
QUEST_20171128_006933	Eminent Vol. 3	에미넌트 이야기3				
QUEST_20171128_006934	Emiment kneeled silently before Gesti. They were on the Fortress of the Land Ruklys had once built. Looking down at Eminent, Gesti spoke with despise.{nl}[You scoured through every body of every miserable human in here for years, and you can't tell me where in this fortress it's hidden?]{nl}Eminent replied in an almost inaudible voice.{nl}[Forgive me.]{nl}In his mind, he wondered for a moment if Vaiga would have understood his situation better than Gesti. She interrupted his train of thought immediately.{nl}[What are you going to do about it? You're a chancellor to those humans now. If the King calls you back to the court, how are you going to keep looking for it? Huh? Look at you. Does it look like you did a good job, playing human like that? What good is it now, if you can't even do you real job?]{nl}	루클리스가 건설한 대지의 요새에서 모든 주위를 물리친 에미넌트는 그곳에 강림한 제스티 앞에 엎드려 있었다.{nl}엎드린 자세의 에미넌트를 내려다 보는 제스티의 입에서 결코 유쾌하지 않은 기색의 말이 떨어졌다.[그래서 결국 인간의 육신까지 뒤집어 쓰는 그 짓거리를 몇 십 년이나 한 꼬락서니의 끝이 겨우 루클리스라는 인간 한 명을 죽이고 그 인간이 감춰둔 계시는 결국 찾지 못했고,이제는 이 요새의 어디에 있는지 알 방법도 없다?]{nl}에미넌트가 제스티의 기분을 살피며 나지막하게 답했다.[죄송합니다.]{nl}그러면서 속으로는 제스티가 아니라 바이가였다면 자신의 발상을 이해할 수도 있었지 않을까 하는 불만도 약간 들었다.{nl}그러는 중에도 제스티의 질타는 이어졌다.[그래서 이제 어떻게 할 참이냐?그 같지도 않은 인간의 재상 직위에 올라있으니 결국 왕도로 돌아가야 할 테고,이제 더는 대지의 요새에 머물며 탐색을 계속할 수도 없지 않느냐?{nl}너는 인간의 행태를 본받아 한 일이 성과를 냈다고 생각했겠지만,지금 이 꼴을 봐라.뭐 하나 이룬 것도 없이 네 스스로 만든 재상의 직위에 갇혀 정작 네 본연의 임무가 방해 받고 있지 않느냐?]{nl}				에미넌트 이야기3
QUEST_20171128_006935	Eminent could no longer stand listening to Gesti berate him in silence.{nl}[As chancellor I have authority over many human subordinates, including armies. Even if I return to the capital, I can send soldiers under my orders to continue looking...]	에미넌트는 제스티의 질책을 그냥 듣고 있을 수 없어 대답했다.[진짜 목적을 숨기고 부릴 인간 병사들과 부하들이 많은 것이 현재 제가 가진 인간사회의 권력입니다.제가 수도로 돌아간 뒤에도 제 명을 받은 관리들과 병사들이 계속 수색을 중단하지 않고...]				에미넌트 이야기3
QUEST_20171128_006936	Angered, Gesti spoke over him.{nl}[And start depending on those filthy humans again? You couldn't find it, but you think they can? What are you even thinking??]{nl}Seeing the ire in Gesti's eyes, Eminent lowered his head. She continued.{nl}[You've been living with them for too long. I want you to stop playing chancellor and focus on your job for once. Just find me the Revelation]{nl}Eminent rushed to answer.{nl}[I remind you that my position would be very useful for keeping humans away while we're searching. I can have the measures taken under my orders, then kill my human character and return to this place immediately to continue the search. Please, allow me to do so.]	제스티가 그 말을 가로막고 역정을 냈다.[그러고도 또 인간들을 의지하겠다고?네 놈이 찾지 못한 것을 그 알량한 인간들이 찾을 수 있다고?너 지금 무슨 생각을 하는 거냐?]{nl}제스티의 분노가 눈에 보이자 에미넌트는 더욱 엎드렸다.제스티의 말이 이어졌다.[아무래도 인간들 사이에서 네가 너무 오랜 산 게야.당장 그 꼴 같지 않은 인간 재상질은 관두고 이곳 대지의 요새에서 그 루클리스라는 인간이 감춘 계시를 찾는 일에 집중해라.]{nl}에미넌트는 그 명령을 그대로 따를 수 없기에 황급히 말했다.[일단은 다른 인간들이 이 주변에 공연히 오지 못하도록 차단하려면 인간의 직위가 유용합니다.제가 몇 가지 조처를 취한 뒤에 자연스럽게 수명이 다해 죽은 것으로 보인 뒤 이곳으로 빠른 시일 내에 돌아와 말씀하신 일을 완수하겠습니다.부디 허락해 주시기 바랍니다.]				에미넌트 이야기3
QUEST_20171128_006937	Gesti wasn't overly pleased with Eminent's plan, but she agreed to it.{nl}[You were the first to kill Laima's chosen keeper, I suppose. I'll allow it.]{nl}Hearing Gesti's voice soften, Eminent pushed for a second request.{nl}[I have only one more thing to ask.]{nl}[What is it?]	제스티는 그 말이 별로 마음에 들지는 않았으나 결국 에미넌트의 요청을 받아들였다.[아무튼, 라이마가 택한 인간 수호자를 죽인 것은 네가 처음이다.그 점을 참작해 네 요청을 허락하겠다.]{nl}이 허락의 말이 떨어지자 에미넌트는 바로 다음 요청을 내밀었다.[한 가지 청이 더 있습니다.[뭔가?]				에미넌트 이야기3
QUEST_20171128_006938	Premier Eminent thought carefully on how to convey his second request to Demon Lord Gesti.{nl}[Many of Ruklys' followers are still living in a city near the fortress called Roxona. My soldiers have been keeping guard at the fortress for now, but they can't do that forever. If we let them be, his followers will try to invade the fortress. But I also can't arrest an entire city...]{nl}[Spare me the details of human society. Just say what you want to do.]{nl}[If you could destroy the city with your powers...]{nl}[Why don't you do it yourself?]{nl}[I certainly could, with the right amount of preparation and the right tools.

The goddesses didn't do anything then, why would they care now? I doubt they'll even find out about it.]	프리미어 에미넌트는 자신의 두 번째 요청이 마왕 제스티에게 어떻게 비춰질지 고민하면서도 말했다.[대지의 요새 인근 도시 록소나에는 루클리스의 추종자들이 아직도 많이 살고 있습니다. 현재는 제 병사들이 출입을 통제하고 있지만,언제까지 그럴 수는 없습니다.{nl}이들은 이곳에 그냥 두어도 방해가 될 가능성이 높고,추방해도 문제입니다.추방된 자들 가운데 혹시라도 루클리스가 몰래 남긴 지시라도 받은 자가 있을 가능성도 있습니다.그렇다고 한 도시의 구성원 전부를 어딘가에 가두는 일은..]{nl}[구질구질한 인간사회의 일을 더 듣고 싶지 않다.자세한 사정이야 내 알 바 아니고 그래서 네가 하고 싶은 말이 뭐냐?]{nl}[제스티님의 능력으로 도시 전체를 사멸시켜 주십시오.][그 정도는 너도 할 수 있을 것 같은데?]{nl}[저도 물론 시간을 들여 준비를 갖추고 귀한 재료를 모아 제대로 된 의식을 시행하면 그럴 수 있습니다.그러나 한 도시의 인간들을 모두 사멸시키는 일은 여신들도 묵과하지 않을 것입니다.무엇보다 그 협정이 있지 않습니까?]{nl}[너는 귀족 가문의 일원이 되기 위해 그 집안 사람들을 몰살시키지 않았던가?그 때도 여신들은 나서지 않았는데 문제가 될까?그녀들은 모르지 않을까?]				에미넌트 이야기3
QUEST_20171128_006939	Eminent replied.{nl}[Those humans died from an epidemic. It's true that I created the disease and made it spread, but ultimately I didn't kill them. The locals saw me as a virtuous man. Not to mention the scale of that was much smaller than an entire city. This will be a much more serious violation of the agreement in the eyes of the goddesses.]	에미넌트가 대답하였다.[엄밀히 말하면 그 때 사람들이 죽은 것은 전염병 탓입니다.제가 그 병을 퍼뜨리고 부추긴 것은 사실이지만,그래도 아무튼 질병으로 죽은 것은 질병으로 죽은 것입니다.{nl}더구나 그 지역 영지민들은 제 덕을 많이 보기도 했습니다.무엇보다 그건 이번에 하려는 것처럼 대규모 사건이 아니었습니다.이 정도 규모의 일이라면 여신들도 심각한 협정위반으로 생각할 것입니다.]				에미넌트 이야기3
QUEST_20171128_006940	Gesti was engrossed in her thoughts for a moment. To her, humans were of no particular interest. The same could not be said about the goddesses. Knowing the next step of Giltine's great plan, she did not want to provoke them. But most of all, there was the agreement that could not be broken by either side. They had apologized for minor transgressions before, but to completely disregard the agreement was yet out of the question.	제스티는 그 말을 듣고 잠시 생각에 잠겼다.인간들은 그녀에게 어떤 관심사도 아니었으나 여신은 달랐다.길티네가 세운 다음 계획에 대해 약간 알고 있는 제스티로서는 지금 시점에서 여신을 크게 자극하는 일은 삼가하고 싶었다.{nl}무엇보다 그들 양자 사이에는 아직은 먼저 깨뜨릴 수 없는 협정이 체결되어 있었다.{nl}그들은 그 협정을 때때로 사소하게 위반하고 사과하거나 배상을 하기도 했지만,작정하고 크게 위반한 적은 없었다.그것은 아직은 할 수 없는 일이었다.				에미넌트 이야기3
QUEST_20171128_006941	Gesti finally spoke again.{nl}[Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to cast a petrifying curse on the city. In theory, the humans can return to normal when the curse is broken, so they won't be dead. Meanwhile, you can use your authority in the human Kingdom to move the petrified ones to another location. That will keep them away without us needing to kill them. Whatever happens next will be the work of the humans, meaning Zemyna as well will be less likely to suspect us.]	이윽고 제스티가 말했다.[이렇게 하도록 하자.내가 그 도시에 석화의 저주를 내리겠다.그렇게 하면 이론상 그곳의 인간들은 저주가 풀리면 백 년 후라도 다시 살아날 수 있으니 몰살시킨 것은 아니다.{nl}그런 다음에 네 장기를 발휘해 인간의 국왕을 부추겨 석상이 된 시민들을 다른 곳으로 옮기도록 하라.이렇게 하면 우리는 인간의 삶을 방해하긴 하였으나 죽인 것은 아니다.그리고 그 다음에 벌어진 일은 같은 인간인 국왕의 명령으로 일어난 일이니 제미나도 우리를 추궁할 근거가 많이 줄어든다.]				에미넌트 이야기3
QUEST_20171128_006942	{nl}[Understood. If we can also convince the humans that it's a curse from the goddesses, like the rumors about Ruklys, I don't think anything can stop this plan.]	{nl}[탁견이십니다.아울러 이 일이 반역자 루클리스의 행위를 마땅치 않게 여긴 여신들의 저주라는 소문을 인간사회에 퍼지도록 하면 더할 나위 없을 듯합니다.]				에미넌트 이야기3
QUEST_20171128_006943	[You can take care of that yourself, just focus on the goal. Remember, we're not trying to kill Laima's chosen keepers; what we want is the Revelations and nothing more. Be grateful that Giltine hasn't punished you yet, and work harder to finish your job. That's what you really ought to do.]{nl}With these words, Gesti disappeared.	[그런 것은 네가 알아서 하도록 하라.명심해야 할 것은 우리가 얻고자 하는 것은 라이마의 뜻대로 움직이는 선택 받은 소위 계시의 수호자 인간들을 죽이는 것이 목적이 아니라 그들이 지닌 계시를 우리 손에 넣는 것이다.{nl}길티네님께서 나와 너희들이 모두 아무런 성과를 내지 못하고 있음에도 아직 우리에게 아무런 벌을 내리지 않고 계신 것을 감사하게 여기고 분발하도록 해야 할 것이다.]그 말과 함께 제스티의 모습이 사라졌다.				에미넌트 이야기3
QUEST_20171128_006944	Premier Eminent was finally able to stand again. He was burdened with a heavy task. He did not know yet about the long years he would spend inside that fortress, never reaching success. If he did know, he would have perhaps been slightly consoled by the fact that Laima had been left deeply grief-stricken after Ruklys' death under his false accusations. In the conflict between goddesses and demons, that too was a victory.	프리미어 에미넌트는 그제야 몸을 일으켰다.그는 이제부터 할 일이 많이 있었지만,어두운 지하요새에서 기나긴 세월 동안 그 일을 성공하지 못하고 시간을 보내게 될 것은 이 때는 몰랐다.{nl}다만 그가 알았다면 조금 위안이 될 사실이 있다면, 라이마가 자신이 택한 루클리스가 누명을 쓰고 죽어간 사실에 대해 진심으로 슬퍼하고 있었다는 점이다.어찌되었든 그것은 여신과 마족의 싸움에서 마족이 거둔 작지만 분명한 승리이기는 했다.				에미넌트 이야기3

QUEST_20171128_006949	The Story of Mirtis	미르티스 이야기				
QUEST_20171128_006950	Years had passed since Gesti sent her demon lords after Laima, yet they had all failed to find Her. Chasing a goddess that could see into the future was far from an easy task, but lately they had made considerable progress in tracking Her steps.	제스티의 명령으로 여러 마군주들이 라이마의 뒤를 추적한 지 오랜 시간이 지났지만,성공한 마군주는 아무도 없었다.{nl}한 발 앞서 모든 일을 내다보고 피할 수 있는 예지의 여신을 찾아내는 일은 절대 쉬울 수가 없기에 당연한 일일 수 있었지만,최근 들어 라이마의 행보를 추적하는 일에 진전이 있었다.				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006951	Eminent was certain Laima had become restless after her chosen keeper Ruklys was assassinated. Mirtis thought otherwise.	에미넌트는 이것이 그가 라이마가 선택한 루클리스를 죽인 탓에 라이마가 충격을 받았다는 주장을 하기도 했지만, 미르티스가 보기에는 말도 안 되는 일이었다.				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006952	It was reasonable to think Laima was slowly losing her powers after creating the first Revelation. Mirtis believed the demon lords were closer to Her than ever before. For one, they had almost caught the goddess in Siauliai Woods. They had since lost track of Her again, but they were confident She was near.{nl}Mirtis, in particular, possessed a means for reconnaissance other demons did not. She had found Laima accompanied by a man in a human prison, and there too she had nearly caught Her.{nl}None of the demon lords, however, had come close enough to Laima to properly confront Her.	그 보다는 라이마가 계시를 만드는 일이 힘겨워서 점점 그 능력이 줄어들고 있는 것이 아닌지 의심하는 것이 타당했다.{nl}아무튼 미르티스가 보기에 마군주들이 라이마를 추격하기 시작한 이래 그 어느 누구보다 그리고 그 어느 때보다 지금이 라이마를 바짝 추적하고 있다는 생각이 들었다.{nl}샤울레이 숲에서는 거의 뒷덜미를 잡을 수 있지 않을까 싶을 정도로 접근한 일도 있었다.그 뒤로 현재 잠시 놓치기는 했지만,다시 찾아내는 일은 어렵지 않게 여겨졌다.무엇보다 미르티스에게는 다른 마군주들에게는 없는 정찰 수단도 있었다.{nl}아니나 다를까 인간이 만든 감옥에 한 남자와 같이 있던 라이마를 발견하였으나 여기서도 아슬아슬한 차이로 상대를 놓쳤다.{nl}그러나 이제까지 라이마를 추적한 이래 잠시라도 한 장소에서 라이마를 직접 볼 정도로 접근했던 마군주도 없었다.				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006953	Mirtis saw their progress as a positive sign; she was certain She would not escape their grip for much longer. She knew from the glimpses she took of Her that Laima had assumed the form of a weak human child. She did not look as if She could withstand an attack if she were to confront Her.	미르티스는 이것을 매우 긍정적인 진전으로 생각했고,다음 번에 발견할 때는 절대로 놓치지 않을 것이란 확신이 들었다.{nl}미르티스가 잠시 본 바로는 라이마는 그냥 봐도 연약해 보이는 인간 소녀의 모습이었고,기본적으로 상태 자체가 정상이 아니라고 보여서 미르티스를 감당할 능력이 없어 보였다.				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006954	And so, when Laima was finally sighted in the Crystal Mine, Mirtis hurried to inspect the location for possible escape routes.{nl}She couldn't rule out the possibility of Her using teleportation to flee, either. She modified the mine walls to collapse on any signs of teleportation. Anyone attempting it would become trapped in the mine before they had the chance to escape.{nl}Realizing there were no means left for Laima to exit the mine, Mirtis felt assured and excited.	그리하여 마침내 수정광산의 한 갱도에 있는 라이마를 탐지한 순간,미르티스는 혹시라도 라이마가 달아날 곳이 있는지 점검하였다.{nl}그 점검에는 순간이동의 가능성을 없애는 것도 포함되었다.{nl}라이마든 누구든 이제 이 광산에서 순간이동을 하려면 광산이 무너져 이동을 하기 전에 묻힐 것이다.{nl}라이마가 현재 있는 장소에서 도저히 달아날 수 없다는 점을 깨닫고 미르티스는 더욱 즐거운 마음이 들었다.				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006955	Perhaps because of this, Mirtis had failed to notice the man that accompanied Laima until She came into sight. She was ready to address Her.{nl}[At last, I become the one to stand before you. Other demon lords have chased your path, only to abandon it without ever seeing your shadow. But now you're here. The curtain has fallen.]{nl}It wasn't Laima, but Cunningham, the man beside Her, who replied.{nl}[Did it cross your mind that we could be the ones waiting for you?]	그런 탓인지 라이마 앞에 출현할 때까지 라이마 옆에 한 인간 남자가 있다는 사실은 신경도 쓰지 않고 있었다.{nl}라이마 앞에 선 미르티스가 대화를 시작했다.[이 일이 시작된 이래 그대를 직접 마주한 자는 오직 나뿐인 듯하오. 모든 마군주들이 그대의 그림자도 보지 못하고 뒤를 따르다 그치고 말았지. 하지만 이제 길었던 추적도 여기서 나에 의해 막을 내리게 되었소.]{nl}라이마는 아무 말도 하지 않았지만, 라이마의 옆에 선 인간 남자; 커닝햄이 입을 열었다.[우리가 일부러 너를 여기서 기다렸다는 생각은 해본 적이 없나?]				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006956	Mirtis retorted.{nl}[Insolent. Whether you waited for me makes no difference. Our matters do not pertain to you, human. What makes you believe you have the right to impose yourself?]	미르티스가 말했다.[말투가 불손하구나.그러나 하여간 라이마와 네가 지쳐서 여기서 멈췄더라도 결과는 다를 바가 없다.그리고 인간이 우리의 일에 끼어들 주제가 된다고 생각하는 것인가?]				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006957	Mirtis shifted her attention from Cunningham to Laima.{nl}[I have received orders from Giltine to strongly encourage you to surrender the Revelation. Should you refuse, it is my duty to seize it through whatever means necessary. Let us make a peaceful agreement. I am willing to be courteous.]	미르티스는 커닝햄에는 더 이상 개의치 않고 라이마에게 다시 말을 걸었다.[길티네님의 엄격한 명령에 따라 그대를 마주치면 우리는 일단 다시 한 번 그대를 권면하도록 되어 있소.{nl}하지만 끝까지 우리의 권면을 받아들이지 않는다면 무슨 수단을 쓰든 그대와 그대가 준비하고 있는 소위 계시를 포획하라는 것이 또한 우리가 받은 명령이오.그러니 아직 우리가 당신을 예우로 대할 때 협조하도록 하시오.]				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006958	Laima was once again silent. It was Cunningham who continued.{nl}[We waited for you here precisely because we can no longer escape. Although, if you didn't know yet, this mine has been excavated for centuries.]{nl}[That means...?]{nl}Cunningham replied before Mirtis could finish her sentence.{nl}[It's an old, old mine. The lots with no more crystals are already closed. Even if one collapsed, no one would know someone was ever there, and certainly no one would ever dig there again on purpose.]{nl}[And...?]	그러나 라이마는 아무 말도 하지 않았고 커닝햄은 말을 계속 이었다.[우리가 이곳에서 너를 기다리기로 한 것은 물론 더 이상 도망치기 어렵기 때문이다. 그런데 네가 아는지 모르겠으나 수정광산은 수 백 년을 채굴해 온 광산이다.]{nl}[그것이 어쨌다는 것이냐?]{nl}미르티스가 이렇게 말하자 커닝햄이 대답했다.[오래된 광산이기에 더 이상 수정이 나오지 않는 광구는 폐쇄된다는 뜻이지. 따라서 이곳은 설령 무너져도 다시는 아무도 여기에 사람이 있었다는 것도 모를 테고 구태여 다시 파낼 가능성도 없다는 말이다.]{nl}[그래서?]				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006959	Cunningham had his answer ready.	그 질문에 커닝햄이 대답했다.

[그래서 너를 여기 봉인하고 이곳 광구를 무너뜨리면 너는 봉인의 마력 탓에 영원히 갇히고, 광부들이 어쩌다 이곳을 파서 널 꺼내줄 리도 없다는 말이다. 그리고 라이마님의 말씀에 따르면 네가 실패하면 네 상관이라는 마왕도 너를 구해줄 리가 없다고 하셨다. 그러니까 너는 여기서 끝이란 말이다.]{nl}그 말과 동시에 커닝햄은 동그란 물체를 하나 꺼냈다. 자세히 본다면 실을 자는데 사용하는 물레를 닮았고, 전체적으로 바퀴(wheel) 모양으로 생긴 것이었다.				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006960	In that moment, the 4 Divine Orbs were used for the first time in history. In the future, they would help fight against the great World Tree disaster. The Divine Orb of Rimgaudas, the first Paladin Master, would also contribute to defeating Mirtis' master Gesti not too far from there. But in that moment, it was Mirtis who fell victim to the Orbs first powerful attack.	부가해두는 이야기이지만, 이것은 훗날 4대 성구라고 불리며 식물대재앙이 왕도에 발생하여 세계수가 폭주했을 때 그 재앙을 축소시켜 안정시키는데 공헌한 성구가 처음으로 세상에서 사용되는 순간이었다.{nl}훗날 초대 팔라딘 마스터 림가우다스가 남긴 또 다른 성구가 미르티스의 상관인 제스티를 격퇴하는 일도 여기서 멀리 떨어지지 않은 곳에서 일어날 사건이지만,여하튼 미르티스는 마족으로서는 처음으로 이 마왕도 격퇴할 수 있다는 성구의 공격을 받은 최초의 사례가 되었다.				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006961	Mirtis tried to move, but she realized she no longer felt the passing of time around her. If time was a stream, it now felt like a pond. If time was freezing, she thought, she would move through space. But space, too, had been blocked ??by herself just a few moments earlier, no less. She could do nothing but stay there, unable to move.	미르티스가 뭔가 해보려고 했을 때 그녀는 더 이상 자신 주변의 시간이 정상적으로 흐르지 않는다는 사실을 깨달았다.{nl}그것은 시간이라는 격류가 그 물살이 약해지면서 마침내 고요한 상태를 유지하는 호수 같은 상태로 변하고 있음을 의미했다.{nl}시간이 막혔다면 공간을 이동해야 했으나 바로 그 길을 조금 전에 스스로 막았다는 사실을 깨닫자 미르티스는 움직일 수 없었다.				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006962	She would have tried to escape the influence of the Divine Orb before time stopped still, but her mind, too, was now slowing down to the point where she could no longer control it.{nl}Cunningham waited until she became completely motionless and commented.{nl}[The power of this Orb is remarkable.]{nl}Laima finally replied.{nl}[It is because I am near it. If a human uses it alone, it will not be as powerful.]{nl}[This awful demon isn't going anywhere for a while, that's what's important. But you ought to hurry now. I can take it from here.]{nl}[I would prefer if you did not have to do it.]{nl}[I must. You know so. If the mine isn't destroyed, there's always the chance that other demons, or even humans, can wander upon this place. Not only that...]	미르티스는 그 호수의 물이 더 이상 바람에 잔물결조차 일어나지 않는 동결상태가 되기 전에 자신이 물레바퀴 성구의 영향력 아래에서 빠져나가야 한다고 생각했지만, 이미 몸뿐 아니라 정신 마저 뜻대로 되지 않는 것을 느꼈다.{nl}미르티스가 완전히 묶이고 어디에도 얼음 따위는 보이지 않았으나 얼어붙은 것처럼 보이자 커닝햄이 말했다.[이 성구의 위력이 정말 대단하군요.]{nl}라이마가 말했다.[그것은 내가 바로 그 곁에 있었던 까닭도 있습니다.인간이 홀로 사용한다면 다음 번에는 지금 정도의 위력은 나오지 않을 것입니다.]{nl}커닝햄이 말했다.[상관없습니다. 이 마군주 녀석은 한동안 이곳에 있을 테니까요. 어서 떠나십시오. 제가 마무리를 하겠습니다.]{nl}[당신이 하려는 일 하지 않았으면 좋겠습니다.]{nl}[아니오. 그럴 수 없다는 사실을 아시지 않습니까? 제가 광산을 무너뜨려야 다른 잡다한 마족이나 혹시라도 우연히 이곳에 들어오는 인간이 사달을 일으킬 가능성이 없어집니다. 무엇보다..]				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006963	Cunningham paused to ponder on his words.{nl}[Not only that, the Orb is set to reappear at a different location after its owner's death. It was you who said so. We mustn't let the Orb stay here, for the sake of our future. If I die here, the Orb will be gone and we will have achieved our goal. I'm certain Ruklys would have approved. He can't have died for the goddesses in vain!]	커닝햄이 말을 잠시 끊었다가 이었다.[무엇보다 이 성구는 현재 소유자가 죽으면 다른 곳으로 사라진다고 알려준 사람은 라이마님이십니다.미래를 위해서라도 이 성구는 이곳에 남아있으면 안 됩니다.이곳을 무너뜨리고 내가 여기서 죽으면 두 가지 일이 동시에 성공적으로 완료됩니다.{nl}죽은 루클리스도 내 이런 행위를 반드시 칭찬할 겁니다.그렇지 않으면 여신님을 위해 죽은 그 녀석이 가엽지 않습니까?]				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006964	Grief washed over Laima at the mention of Ruklys' name and she finally agreed with Cunningham. She blessed his noble sacrifice and left the mine. In Her remained the deep sorrow of the memories She had sought to forget.{nl} 	라이마는 루클리스의 이름이 나오자 다시 슬픔을 느끼며 결국 커닝햄의 말에 동의했다.라이마는 커닝햄의 희생을 축복하고 그 자리를 떠났다. 머지 않아 지금의 기억을 또 다시 오랜 시간 잊고 지낼 것이란 사실이 이 가녀린 여신의 마음을 다시 한번 아프게 만들었다.{nl} 

다행인지 불행인지 라이마는 커닝햄이 일으킨 폭음을 듣기 전에 수정광산을 벗어날 수 있었다.				미르티스 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006965	Gesti and Ausura	제스티와 아우스라				
QUEST_20171128_006966	Gesti worried. She worried constantly about her failed attempts to track down Laima, the important task Giltine had assigned for her, but this time, there was something else on her mind. Kartas, forever under the direct orders of Giltine, was unlikely to be sent our to help her, but she may have to deal with Demon Lord Nebulas, his subordinate. Gesti was not looking forward to that.	제스티에게는 고민이 있었다. 길티네로부터 받은 라이마의 계시 추적임무가 아직 성공할 기미가 없다는 사실만으로도 그녀의 고민거리는 충분했지만, 지금 그녀는 그 외에도 다른 고민거리를 안고 있었다.{nl}길티네의 엄중한 경고로 어디로 튈지 모르는 카르타스는 추적임무에 개입할 수 없었지만, 필요에 의해 빌린 카르타스의 부하 마군주 네뷸라스를 다루는 문제는 그녀가 감당해야 했기 때문이다.				제스티와 아우스라
QUEST_20171128_006967	Unlike Kartas, Nebulas was virtually uncontrollable. More often than not, his appetite for violence did nothing to help the task at hand. For now, however, she had little choice.	네뷸라스의 제어할 수 없는 성격은 카르타스와 달리 단 하나, 그의 살육 성향뿐이지만, 그것이 임무에 방해가 될 것은 틀림없었다.{nl} 그렇다고 누군가를 곁에 붙여둘 수도 없었다.				제스티와 아우스라
QUEST_20171128_006968	She could not summon another demon lord for the sole purpose of keeping Nebulas on a figurative leash. Neither could she discard Nebulas or return him to Kartas. In the end the fact remained that, without a powerful demon on her side, getting hold of the Revelation seemed all but impossible.{nl}The only way she saw was to have Nebulas regulate his own temper. Gesti was in the middle of agonizing over how to get the unruly demon to behave when she heard steps coming in her direction.{nl}[Master. What is it that occupies your mind?]	네뷸라스를 누를 정도로 강한 마군주를 단순히 고삐 역할로 사용할 수는 없기 때문이다.{nl}그렇다고 네뷸라스를 쓰지 않거나 카르타스에게 돌려보내기도 어려운 상황이었다. 무엇보다 라이마와 계시를 추적할 정도로 강한 마군주가 필요한 것은 분명한 사실이었기 때문이다.{nl}그렇다면 결국 네뷸라스 스스로 자제하도록 만들어야 했다. 그러나 필요하다고 해서 좋은 생각이 나는 것이 아니기에 무슨 수로 그렇게 할지 제스티는 번민하고 있었다.{nl}그 때 누군가 그에게 말을 걸었다.[위대한 제스티시여. 무슨 고민을 지니고 계십니까?]				제스티와 아우스라
QUEST_20171128_006969	The words belonged to Ausura, a demon lord who took orders exclusively from Gesti. Along with Diena Frieblander, Ausura was one of the helpers created by Gesti to manage the demon realm in her absence. She served also as Gesti's advisor, and she was known to be a very devoted demon.{nl}That day, like most other days, she listened carefully to the master's woes before offering her word of advice.	말을 건 것은 오직 제스티의 명령만을 받는 직속의 여성 마군주 아우스라였다. 디에나 프리블랜더와 더불어 제스티가 직접 만들어낸 마군주 가운데 하나로 제스티의 부재시 그녀의 마계 영역을 대신 관리하고 여러 사안에 대해 의논자 역할을 하는 충성스런 마족이다.{nl} 잠시 시간이 흐르고 아우스라는 제스티의 고민이 무엇인지 파악하자 이렇게 그녀의 조언했다.				제스티와 아우스라
QUEST_20171128_006970	[Would it perhaps be best not to summon him? He is dangerous. If you consider his nature, he seems far more likely to hinder rather than contribute to your goal. There's no telling the sort of damage he could cause.]{nl}[Unfortunately I can't leave him alone, either.]{nl}[Luckily, Nebulas is not without his interests. If you remember, Kartas erased his memories when he created him. Because of this, he is obsessed with finding details of his previous life. Surely that can be used to control him.]	[그냥 묵혀두는 것이 좋다고 사료됩니다. 네뷸라스는 너무 위험합니다. 그 자가 일을 망칠 가능성을 고려하면 그를 투입하는 일은 결국 손해를 자초하는 일입니다. 그리고 그것이 돌이킬 수 없는 손해가 되지 말란 법이 없습니다.]{nl}[하지만 그 자를 가만히 있도록 놓아둘 방법도 마땅치 않다.]{nl}[다행히 네뷸라스에게는 한 가지 강한 집착이 있습니다. 카르타스가 그 자를 만들 때 기억을 지웠기에 그의 생전 사실에 대한 강한 집착이 있습니다. 그 점으로 그를 강제할 수는 없어도 움직이지 않도록 통제할 수 있습니다.]				제스티와 아우스라
QUEST_20171128_006971	[It's nothing I haven't thought about myself. The problem is that I can't give him what he wants.]	[그 점 역시 생각하지 않은 것은 아니나, 내가 그 자가 원하는 것을 제공할 수 없다는 문제가 있다.]				제스티와 아우스라
QUEST_20171128_006972	[Perhaps not immediately, but in the future. I will make it my task. Kartas is not the most thorough of personalities, after all. With the right amount of research, I'm sure I will find something he wants. For one, there is the fact that Kartas has kept Nebulas from his memories all along. No other demon lord has ever dared to cross Kartas' will in favor of Nebulas, but if I were to intervene, uncovering the clues of his past would only be a matter of time.]	[지금은 못하시지만 나중에는 가능합니다. 그 일은 제가 맡겠습니다. 카르타스는 꼼꼼한 성격의 인물이 아닙니다.{nl}명색이 마군주인 제가 철저히 조사를 하면 나중에는 제공할 것이 있을 것입니다. 네뷸라스가 자신의 과거에 집착하면서도 별다른 성과를 내지 못하는 것은 카르타스가 그에게 금제를 걸어 유독 그 일에는 제대로 된 인지를 하지 못하기 때문입니다.{nl}하지만 다른 마군주라면 다릅니다. 이제까지는 예측 불가능하면서 강하기까지 한 카르타스의 비위를 거스르며 네뷸라스를 도울 마군주가 없었지만, 제가 나선다면 시간이 걸릴 뿐이지 결국 단서를 찾을 수 있습니다.]				제스티와 아우스라
QUEST_20171128_006973	[Are you willing to do that?]{nl}[In your name, master, yes. For now, I advise you to keep Nebulas under control. He should be released only in circumstances where he cannot compromise the task. Do not worry about him, master.]{nl}Gesti accepted the advice of her loyal servant. Thus the role of Karta's subordinate Nebulas in the search for the Revelation was delayed until what would be known in future eras as Medzio Diena.	[그렇게 해주겠는가?]{nl}[제가 제스티님을 위해서 그 정도 일을 못할 리가 없지 않습니까? 일단 그렇게 아무 일도 하지 않도록 제어하고 있다가 그자가 설쳐도 무방한 적당한 장소와 임무를 발견하면 그 때 투입하면 됩니다. 더 이상 심려치 마시고 네뷸라스에게 그렇게 말씀만 하십시오.]{nl}제스티는 충성스런 수하인 아우스라의 조언을 받아들였다. 이로써 카르타스의 부하로서 제스티를 돕도록 파견된 네뷸라스의 계시 탐색 투입은 훗날 신수의 날로 식물대재앙이 발발한 시기까지 늦춰졌다.				제스티와 아우스라
QUEST_20171128_006974	Nebulas and Kalejimas	네뷸라스와 칼레이마스				
QUEST_20171128_006975	Nebulas found himself suppressing the desire to attack the demon lord standing in front of him. He composed himself as best as he could before finally addressing Ausura.{nl}[So you're saying you found out what I wanted to know, but you're only telling me now.]{nl}Ausura sensed his hostility, but tried to remain collected.{nl}[That information was of no use to you before today, you see.]	네뷸라스는 눈앞의 아우스라를 당장 공격하고 싶은 마음을 간신히 눌렀다.{nl}그러느라 꽤 시간을 들인 다음에야 아우스라를 보며 말을 할 수 있었다.[그러니까 네 말은 네가 이미 오래 전에 내가 원하는 단서를 얻고도, 그 사실을 지금까지 감춰왔다는 것이군.]{nl}아우스라는 네뷸라스의 공격을 전혀 꺼리지 않는 것은 아니지만 그럼에도 태도는 침착했다.[어차피 그 정보는 오늘 시점 이전에는 알아봐야 도움이 안 되었습니다.]				네뷸라스와 칼레이마스
QUEST_20171128_006976	[There's no reason I couldn't have gone there before. Wouldn't have been that big of a problem for our masters.]{nl}[I do believe it would have hindered the work we are doing for our masters. However I see no obstacles to it now. I would assume you are free to move there as you wish.]{nl}[It's in Kalejimas, is it?]	[너와 네 주인 방해했을 뿐이지 내가 그곳으로 가서 일을 하는 것은 지장이 없었다.]{nl}[물론 그렇습니다만, 우리는 그랬다면 큰 문제가 되었을 것이라 생각합니다. 여하튼 이제 관련된 사실도 알았고, 나설 수 있는 조건도 갖췄으니 지금이라도 서두르시면 될 듯합니다.]{nl}[칼레이마스에 있다고?]				네뷸라스와 칼레이마스
QUEST_20171128_006977	[That is correct. Although I must remind you. You mustn't act solely in your own interests. It is extremely important that you retrieve the Revelation that is guarded inside.]{nl}[I know.]{nl}[After all, this is a unique opportunity for yourself. Do not be ungrateful for what destiny has brought you.]{nl}	[네, 그렇습니다. 또한 당연히 알고 있겠지만, 당신의 관심사만 챙기면 안 됩니다. 칼레이마스의 누군가가 갖고 있을 라이마의 계시 역시 반드시 찾아야 합니다.]{nl}[알고 있다.]{nl}[무슨 우연인지 섭리인지 그 두 가지가 한 장소에 그것도 당신이 마음껏 활개쳐도 되는 곳에 있어서 다행입니다.]{nl}				네뷸라스와 칼레이마스
QUEST_20171128_006978	[If what you say is true, shouldn't you have told me that sooner?]{nl}[Only now are the humans occupied in dealing with the disaster. Intervening any sooner would have been too great of a risk.]{nl}[So now I can go find the man in Kalejimas and get the information from him, is it?]{nl}[I must remind you, the keeper of the Revelation as well is or was previously in Kalejimas. Do not forget that.]	[네 말대로라면 조금 더 일찍 알려줘도 좋지 않았을까?]{nl}[인간들이 식물의 폭주로 정신 못 차리게 된 것은 이제 와서니까요. 그 전에는 나설 시기가 아니었습니다.]{nl}[그러면 지금 칼레이마스에 갇혀 있다는 전직 관리를 잡아 족치면 된다 이 말이지.]{nl}[다시 한 번 말하지만, 계시의 현 소유자도 칼레이마스에 있거나 혹은 있었습니다. 잊지 않기 바랍니다.]				네뷸라스와 칼레이마스
QUEST_20171128_006979	[I know. But there's something I don't understand. It makes sense that the man who was in charge of the records of all of the Kingdom's families would know about my ancestors and who I was as a human, but wouldn't that information also be in the actual records? It can't all be in his memory...]{nl}	[알고 있다. 그런데 인간 왕국의 모든 가문의 역사에 정통한 의전대신이 내 과거나 혹은 내 인간이었을 시절의 선조의 기록에 관해 알고 있다는 사실은 당연하다고도 할 수 있겠지만, 그 말은 뒤집으면 인간들의 왕실의 기록고에도 그 전임 의전대신이란 자가 아는 사실이 문서로 있을 것 아닌가? 그의 기억 따위가 아니라..]{nl}				네뷸라스와 칼레이마스
QUEST_20171128_006980	[Of course. But as you know, the humans' Kingdom is already in ruins. Retrieving specific documents would become an even more difficult task.]{nl}[That's because you wasted all this time without telling me!]	[물론 그랬을 것입니다. 그러나 이미 인간들의 왕도는 폐도가 되었고 거기서 어떤 문서를 건지기는 어렵습니다.]{nl}[그게 다 망할 네 년이 미리 알리지 않고 잠자코 있던 탓이 아닌가?]				네뷸라스와 칼레이마스
QUEST_20171128_006981	Ausura tried as she could to appear indifferent while Nebulas burned with rage.{nl}[I understand that you're agitated, but there is a riot happening at Kalejimas as we speak. If you're to gain any control there, you must hurry.]{nl}[But if this man I'm going to find is no longer working at the records, then who's in charge of them now? Are they still alive? Are you just keeping more information from me?]	아우스라는 네뷸라스에게서 피어오르는 분노의 불꽃이 실체까지 이루는 것을 보았지만, 개의치 않고 말했다.{nl}[분풀이로 저를 괴롭힐 수도 있겠지만, 지금 칼레이마스는 굳이 외부의 개입이 없어도 소요중이라고 합니다. 그곳을 장악하고 일을 제대로 보려면 서둘러야 할 것입니다.]{nl}[그런데 전임 의전대신이 거기 있다면 현직은 혹시 어디 있나? 아직 살아있지 않은가? 살았는데도 내게 소재를 숨기는 것은 아닌가?]				네뷸라스와 칼레이마스
QUEST_20171128_006982	Ausura sighed at Nebulas' relentless suspicion.{nl}[The human in charge of the records lived in the capital before the great disaster. However, I must warn you not to go there. These are Gesti's orders. You must focus on Kalejimas. Do not attempt to investigate other locations or engage with any other humans. The chances of discovering any traces of old documents in the Fallen City are minimal. Your only sure lead now lies in Kalejimas.]	아우스라는 네뷸라스의 집착에 대놓고 한숨을 쉬면서 말했다.[현직은 수도가 식물폭주로 뒤덮일 때 살았습니다. 그렇지만, 그쪽에다 뭘 하려고 하지 마십시오.{nl}이것은 제스티님의 명령입니다. 칼레이마스에만 집중하기 바랍니다. 그러니 다른 장소나 인간에게 뭔가를 물어볼 생각하지 마라는 말입니다. 결론적으로 폐도의 어느 구석에 운 좋게 옛 기록의 굴러다니는 쪼가리를 얻을 수 없다면, 네뷸라스 당신에게 손 닿을 수 있는 남은 유일한 단서는 칼레이마스에 있다는 것입니다.]				네뷸라스와 칼레이마스
QUEST_20171128_006983	Nebulas, refusing to let Ausura have the final word, threw at her one last question.{nl}[Your boss won't say anything if I have it my way in Kalejimas, will she?]{nl}Ausura's response was harsh.{nl}[Gesti has no interest in whatever havoc you wreak there, so long as you retrieve the Revelation.]{nl}	네뷸라스는 결국 말로 아우스라를 당할 수 없다고 생각하고 자리를 뜨려다가 마지막으로 물었다.[칼레이마스에서는 내가 내 마음대로 한다고 네 주인이 뭐라 하지는 않겠지?]{nl}아우스라가 차갑게 대답했다.[계시만 찾아내 얻는다면 당신이 그곳에서 무슨 살육의 미학을 추구하든 그것은 제스티님의 관심사 밖의 일입니다.]{nl}

그 말에 아우스라를 만난 후 처음으로 네뷸라스는 만족스런 기분을 느끼며 그 자리를 떠날 수 있었다.				네뷸라스와 칼레이마스
QUEST_20171128_006984	The Story of Solcomm	솔콤 이야기				
QUEST_20171128_006985	[Have you called?]{nl}Demon Lord Solcomm stood in front Gesti, the one who had summoned him. Waiting for her reply, he realized once again the complexity of his situation. Formally, he was a servant of Kartas. His work, however, was largely dedicated to Vaiga. And yet there he was, awaiting orders from Gesti. A devoted agent for all three of those high-rank demons.	소환을 받은 자가 앞에 섰다.[부르셨습니까?]{nl}마족의 군주인 솔콤은 마왕 제스티 앞에 섰다.그리고 제스티의 말을 기다리면서 지금 이 순간 자신의 신세가 무척 복잡하다고 생각했다.{nl}형식상으로는 그는 마왕 카르타스의 부하였다.그러나 실제로 그가 충성을 바치는 마왕은 바이가였다.{nl}그런데 지금은 제스티의 명령을 받기 위해 그 앞에 섰으니 그는 이 순간 3대 마왕 모두의 지휘를 받는 셈이다.				솔콤 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006986	Solcomm's ordeal began with Vaiga designating him to work for Kartas in order to spy on the rival demon lord. Giltine, their master, had promptly agreed to Vaiga's proposal, thinking a reasonable demon such as Solcomm would do well to prevent Kartas' incontrollable nature from getting out of hand.	그의 신세가 이렇게 된 것은 마왕 바이가가 카르타스를 견제하고 감시하기 위해 솔콤을 파견 근무의 형식으로 카르타스에게 보냈기 때문이다.{nl}이들 마왕의 상급자인 길티네도 카르타스의 광기와 미친 성격을 알고 있기에 그 밑에 합리적이고 지성적인 마군주 솔콤을 넣으면 카르타스가 사고를 덜 치는데 도움이 된다는 바이가의 의견을 받아들였다.				솔콤 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006987	Some centuries later, Gesti was tasked with chasing Laima, and Giltine allowed her to request the help of other demon lord subordinates, Solcomm included.{nl}The decision did nothing to improve Solcomm's situation. His master used the constant "support missions" and "dispatched operations" as an excuse to achieve what was essentially discarding his least favorite henchmen. Not only that, as the most normal and rational of the lower-ranked demon lords, Solcomm was the obvious choice for Gesti.	그렇게 몇 세기가 지난 어느 날 마왕 제스티에게 라이마를 추적하는 임무가 맡겨졌고,그 임무를 지원하기 위해 다른 마왕이나 마신의 부하 가운데 유능한 자들을 데려다 써도 좋다는 길티네의 선언이 있었다.{nl}길티네의 이러한 지시는 솔콤에게는 뜻밖의 부작용을 불러왔다.마왕 카르타스가 냉큼 솔콤을 제스티를 지원한다는 명목으로 붙여주었기 때문이다.{nl}말이 좋아 출장이고 지원 파견이지 실제로는 가장 싫어하는 부하를 떠넘긴 셈이다.{nl}그런데 카르타스의 부하 중 솔콤이 가장 정상적인 마군주고 똑똑한 편이기 때문에 제스티 처지에서도 솔콤 말고 다른 마군주를 파견하라고 할 수가 없었다.				솔콤 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006988	A stubborn, deranged character like Warpulis would be of no help to the task at hand.	워퓰리스 같은 막무가내의 미친 녀석이 오는 것은 아무런 도움이 되지 않기 때문이다.				솔콤 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006989	Having Nebulas around was more than enough. In the end, it was up to Solcomm to accept the new role under Gesti, now his third master.{nl}In the centuries to come, answering to three masters was bound to do more harm than good, he thought. It lowered the chances of any of them truly supporting him.	그런 녀석은 네뷸라스 만으로도 이미 충분했다.이런 사유로 현재 솔콤은 소속을 두 번이나 바꿔서 제스티 밑으로 와있었다.{nl}이렇게 수 세기 단위로 소속과 주인을 바꾼 일은 솔콤 개인에게도 훗날 크게 불리하게 작용할 가능성이 높았다.{nl}어떤 마왕이나 마신도 그의 편에 서서 그를 지원하지 않을 우려가 있기 때문이다.				솔콤 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006990	 His current master Gesti was, unsurprisingly, beginning to show signs of just that. She addressed him.{nl}[Do you know how long we've been looking for Laima's Revelation? It's bad enough that we haven't made any progress, and it's only going to get worse.]{nl}[Why is that?]{nl}[Ever heard of Lydia Schaffen?]	 현재 상관인 제스티도 솔콤을 개인적으로 살펴줄 까닭이 없었다.그 제스티가 솔콤에게 말했다.[라이마의 계시를 추적한지 그간 세월이 얼마나 흘렀는지 아는가? 그간 성과가 없었다는 점도 과히 기분이 좋지 않은데 최근에는 더 나쁜 일이 생기고 있다.]{nl}[무엇입니까?]{nl}[리디아 샤펜이라고 들어보았나?]				솔콤 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006991	[Yes, I've heard of her. She is exceptionally well-known in the human realm. I don't believe any human in history, not even her mentor Maven, has ever become quite as influential as she.]{nl}[I didn't know you were so keen on human gossip. But alright. What's important is that this woman is guarding Laima's Revelation. And you know what's funny? We know she has it, but we can't even touch her. Every other keeper of a Revelation was either hiding it or protecting it, or at least doing something to keep it off our hands. Maven, the one they call her mentor, is locked inside the Great Cathedral with a Revelation. Tesla, well, he lived for way too long not to be hiding his own Revelation somewhere. His statues are almost as powerful as the goddesses themselves. Even if I catch him, how am I going to interrogate him?	[네 알고 있습니다.아마 인간 왕국의 역사상 그 어느 누구보다도 심지어 최근에는 역대의 어떤 훌륭한 국왕이나 심지어 스승인 메이번 보다 더 높은 명성과 인기를 누리고 있는 인물이라고 알고 있습니다.]{nl}[너도 인간에게 쓸데 없는 관심을 많이 지니고 있었군. 그래 그건 아무래도 좋다. 중요한 것은 그 인간 여자가 라이마의 계시를 맡아 가지고 있다는 사실이지.{nl}그런데 웃기는 일이 무엇인지 아는가?그녀가 지니고 있는 것을 뻔히 아는데 우리가 얻을 수 없다는 점이야.아니 그것이 아니지.이제까지는 계시를 지닌 자들은 숨기를 잘 하거나 방어를 잘 했거나 우리가 미처 그들이 지녔다는 사실을 몰랐거나 하여간 그런 이유들로 계시를 간직할 수 있었다.{nl}대성당에 쳐 박혀 있는 리디아의 스승이라는 메이번도 그러고 있으니 계시를 지키고 있는 것이고,테슬라가 인간의 수명을 넘어서 저렇게 오래 사는 것은 아무리 봐도 수상해서 그가 계시를 지녔을 것 같기도 한데 과연 그런지 알 수가 없는 경우도 있었지.{nl}그 자가 조각하는 여신상들은 거의 여신이 강림한 힘을 발휘해.내 능력으로는 그 놈을 잡아도 문초할 수가 없으니까 답답하지.				솔콤 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006992	The Beholder thinks Tesla has no Revelation. But Lydia Schaffen is different. This woman is different, I'm telling you.]{nl}Solcomm interceded before Gesti's explanation could get any longer.{nl}[She is different, indeed. She defeated six demon lords in the past 27 years. Completely unheard of for a human. And her arrows! There's not a demon's heart that- ahem, I apologize.]	주시자님의 예상과 분석으로는 테슬라에겐 계시가 없다는 거야.하여간 리디아 샤펜은 그 어느 경우와도 달라.이 여자는 정말 다르다고.]{nl}솔콤은 제스티의 설명이 더 길어지기 전에 먼저 상대가 할 말을 꺼냈다.[네 다릅니다. 리디아 샤펜은 지난 27년간 무려 여섯 명의 군주급 마족을 죽이거나 퇴치했습니다.지금까지 역사에 기록된 어떤 인간도 아직 못해낸 일입니다.그녀의 화살은 마왕의 심장도, 크흠 죄송합니다.]				솔콤 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006993	His words were momentarily cut off by Gesti's piercing look, but soon he continued.{nl}[What I mean is that other humans have absolute faith in her arrows.]{nl}[Yes, they have every reason to. That's the problem.]	솔콤은 눈앞의 제스티를 의식해 나오던 말을 잠시 끊었지만 결국 말을 맺었다. [여하간 꿰뚫는다고 인간들은 믿고 있다고 합니다.]{nl}[그래 그리고 더 큰 문제는 그것이 사실이란 점이지.]				솔콤 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006994	Gesti's incredibly rare compliment to a human's power astonished Solcomm. He took the chance to add, [I'm not sure if you're aware, but there is an even greater problem. All the demons she is known for defeating were victims of ingenious tricks. Schaffen is as intelligent as she is talented, and she is extremely resourceful.]{nl}[That's why I called you here. Giltine thinks you're clever enough not to fall for a trap.]	제스티가 인간의 힘에 대해 이렇게 쉽게 긍정하는 것은 솔콤에게도 당혹스러운 일이었다.{nl}그래서 솔콤은 한 걸음 더 나가보기로 했다.[아실지 모르지만,그 보다 큰 문제도 있습니다.리디아 샤펜을 맡았던 마군주들이 그녀의 교묘한 책략에 말려 모습을 나타내고 당하거나 함정에 걸려 당하거나 했다는 점입니다. 궁술실력 못지 않게 무서운 점은 바로 그녀의 지능적인 계략과 준비성 등등 그런 점입니다.]{nl}[그래 그래서 너를 불렀다. 길티네님이 말씀하시기를 너라면 최소한 그렇게 멍청하게 상대에게 이끌려나가 죽지는 않을 것이라고 하셨다.]				솔콤 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006995	[What do you mean?]{nl}[Lately that idiot Ghibulinas thought he could beat brain with brawn and went after Lydia. Ended up crossed by an arrow. Apparently she even got hold of an essence with his magic in it. That's the rumor we heard from his Pawndel minions; the other lords don't know about it yet. He wasn't even assigned to her, who knows why he went and got himself killed for nothing.]	[그 말씀은?]{nl}[최근에 지부리나스 그 멍청한 자식이 힘만 믿고 나섰다가 리디아 샤펜의 화살에 죽었다.리디아는 지부리니스의 마력이 담긴 정수까지 탈탈 털어서 가지고 갔다고 하더군.{nl}어차피 폰델 같은 하급자까지 좍 소문이 퍼지겠지만, 아직은 마군주들도 모르는 일이다.아니 도대체 받은 임무도 없는데 왜 나서서 설치다가 죽었는지 모를 일이다.]				솔콤 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006996	[I'm sorry to hear that.]{nl}[If she kills you too, we'll have no one left to go to for this.]{nl}[Pardon? I- What is that you mean by...?]{nl}[It's your job now to get the Revelation from Lydia Schaffen. Your mission is in a place the humans call the Star something Lake. She is busy there building some kind of tower.]{nl}Solcomm knew this was not an order he was allowed to refuse, and so he signaled to Gesti his obedience. With that began the history of his legendary defeat.	[그거 참 안타까운 일입니다.]{nl}[네가 리디아에게 죽으면 안타깝게 여길 자도 없을 것이다.]{nl}[네? 그게 무슨 그렇다면 혹시..]{nl}[그래 이제부터 리디아 샤펜이 지닌 라이마의 계시를 우리 손에 넣은 일은 네 임무로 배정되었다. 인간들이 별무슨호수라 부르는 곳으로 가라. 리디아는 요즘 그곳에서 무슨 탑인가 뭔가를 만드느라 바쁘다고 들었다.]{nl}어차피 거절할 수 있는 명령이 아니었기에 솔콤은 복종의 의사를 표시하고 물러났다. 그리고 이후 수 세기 동안 기록될 그의 패배의 역사를 시작하려 하고 있었다.				솔콤 이야기
QUEST_20171128_006997	Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 1	솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록1				
QUEST_20171128_006998	If the tower is completed, attacking by force is useless, Solcomm thought.{nl}The cold brawl between him and Schaffenstar was beginning to warm up again. It all started when Solcomm was in the process of gathering his demon henchmen. Mobilizing a large group of demons in the human realm was no easy task, especially when it involved staying under the radar of the goddesses.	‘힘으로 하려면 탑이 완성되기 전에 그리 했어야 했었다’고 솔콤은 생각했다.{nl} 솔콤은 그간 자신과 샤펜스타 사이에 벌어진 싸움을 복기하기 시작했다.{nl}첫 시작은 솔콤이 그가 동원할 수 있는 모든 마족을 집합시키고 모으는 과정이었다.{nl}그렇지만 인간 세계에 마족들을 대량으로 한번에 이동시키는 일은 간단하지 않았고, 무엇보다 여신들의 주목을 끌 우려가 있었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록1
QUEST_20171128_006999	Perhaps fortunately for him, many were the demons Lydia Schaffen had encountered and killed throughout her life, including several high-ranked demon lords. This was a convenient pretext for Solcomm's side to launch a revenge war without over-worrying about their agreement with the goddesses.	불행중 다행으로 리디아 샤펜은 온 세상을 떠돌면서 조우한 많은 마족을 죽였고, 그 중에는 이름있는 상급 마족도 포함되어 있었다. 이것은 명분상 복수전을 빙자할 수 있었기에 일단 여신들과의 협정에서는 자유로운 편이었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록1
QUEST_20171128_007000	Whether it was in true combat, or whether Schaffen killed those demons in self-defense did not matter. The truth remained that they needed to move a whole army of demons. To make matters worse, there was always the chance of an extended war with Lydia and her Schaffenstar organization, which would require constant supply of demon soldiers and trusted officials to command them.{nl}Assembling demon subordinates was an arduous task, even for a demon lord. Hauberk was right when he touted over and over again that demons needed better systematization of their orders. No demon should be without association, he had said.	정당한 일대일 대결이든 마족이 먼저 잘못해서 리디아 샤펜이 정당방위로 죽였든 그것은 상관없는 일이었다.{nl}그렇지만 너무 많은 마족의 이동은 곤란했다. 무엇보다 리다아 샤펜과 그녀가 창단한 샤펜스타 라는 단체와의 전투가 장기전이 될 가능성이 있었기에 마계에서 꾸준히 마족들을 보내며 지원하고 관리할 믿음직한 부하도 필요했다.{nl}그 역할은 프베타라는 상급 마족에게 임무를 주어 맡겼다.{nl}마군주라고 마계의 마족들을 마음대로 동원할 수 있는 것이 아니었다.이럴 때는 언젠가 하우벅이 지나가듯이 한 말처럼 모든 마족이 완벽하게 조직화되고 소속이 없는 마족은 하나도 없는 상태라면 좋았을 것이라는 말도 그럴 듯하다는 생각이 들 정도였다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록1
QUEST_20171128_007001	Unfortunately, being thorough was not in their nature. Orders were given by whichever high-rank official was nearest, so subordinates simply fell under the control of whomever they preferred. The Creator had provided them and the goddesses with enough freedom. It simply happened that the idea of systematization did not conform with their principles. More importantly, when the power of every demon was needed, they had Giltine.	하지만 그런 귀찮은 일은 그들의 천성에 맞지 않았다.{nl}필요할 때 면전에 있는 상급 마족의 명을 따르고, 마음에 맞는 고위 마족이 있으면 그의 직할로 들어가면 되는 일이다.창조주께서는 여신과 그들 모두에게 충분한 능력과 자유를 주셨다.{nl}그런 조직화는 그들의 천성과 무엇보다 그들이 생각하는 창조의 원리에 부합하지 않는다.{nl}무엇보다 정말 모든 마족의 힘이 한번에 필요하다면 길티네님이 모두를 소집하실 것이다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록1
QUEST_20171128_007002	For better or for worse, demons of all degrees answered to Giltine, although the situation did not call for her to mobilize the entire demon forces. They still saw systematization as ineffective and cumbersome, despite some, like Hauberk, believing otherwise.{nl}It took Solcomm longer than expected to gather demons for combat and sufficient minions to serve them. When he finally arrived at Starfilled Lake, he saw in all its glory the Astral Tower, now fully complete and operational.	그러면 싫건 좋건 모두가 길티네님의 명령하에 누가 상대라고 하더라도 그들의 집합된 힘을 보여줄 수 있었다.{nl}언제든지 그럴 수 있는 일을 당장 그럴 필요가 없는데 소속이나 조직을 구성하는 것은 비효율적이고 불편한 일이었다.{nl} 그럼에도 하우벅의 생각을 따르는 자들도 꽤 있는 것 같지만 말이다.{nl}아무튼 솔콤은 마계에서 전투에 참여할 마족을 모으고 지능이 낮은 마물들을 동원하는 등등 사전 준비를 하는 일에 상당한 시간을 들였다.{nl}그리고 마침내 별깃든 호수에 도착했을 때 본 것은 완성되어 완공식까지 진행한 별의 탑의 모습이었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록1
QUEST_20171128_007003	Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 2	솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록2				
QUEST_20171128_007004	It was the day of his first attack. He sighted a few Shaffenstar members scraping the bottom of the lake with rakes and other instruments, and he gave his subordinates orders to charge.{nl}The first demon hadn't yet reached the side of the lake when they heard the alarm sound inside the Astral Tower. Given its enormous height, it became clear that a surprise attack was all but impossible. Perhaps they would have been more successful on a foggy day, although fog was rarely an occurrence near that lake. It was said to be one of the reasons Lydia Schaffen had chosen it in the first place.	처음으로 전투를 작정한 날이었다. 멀리 샤펜스타의 단원들이 호수 위에 서서 갈퀴와 기타 연장으로 바닥을 긁고 있는 모습을 보며 부하 마족들 일부에게 시험 삼아 돌격 명령을 내렸다.{nl}그런데 아직 선두가 물에 닿지도 않았는데 별의 탑에서는 적을 발견하자 경보를 발했다.{nl}탑의 위치가 높다 보니 감시 임무를 맡은 자들이 전부 졸고 있지 않는 한, 기습이란 것은 불가능하다. 안개가 낀 날을 골라볼 수도 있었겠지만, 오늘의 전투는 예비 시험의 성격을 지니고 있었다. 게다가 이 호수는 안개 끼는 날은 많지 않은 호수였다. 리디아 샤펜이 이곳을 택한 이유 중 하나라고 한다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록2
QUEST_20171128_007005	The Shaffenstar members working around the lake had heard the alarm and were preparing to abandon the location. As the lake was only ankle-deep, from far away it looked as if the people were walking on the water. Steady but collected, they hurried back inside the tower.{nl}The alarm had come too fast for the demons to attempt an attack on the returning members. Solcomm did not release any more orders to his men, but as the first demons made contact with the lake, something unexpected happened.	호수에 선 채로 작업을 하던 단원들이 경보를 듣고 장비를 챙겨 복귀할 준비를 하고 있었다. 호수는 발목 높이 정도만 물이 찬다고 들었다. 과연 멀리서 보면 사람이 그냥 물위에 서있는 것처럼 보였다. 여하간 단원들이 빠르게 탑으로 돌아가고 있었다. 서두르기는 했지만, 당황한 기색은 보이지 않았다.{nl}경보가 빨랐기 때문에 탑으로 귀환하는 자들을 때 맞춰 공격하는 것은 불가능해 보였다. 솔콤은 딱히 그럴 생각도 없었기에 선두를 재촉하는 명령을 보내지 않았다. 그런데 선두가 물에 닿자 전혀 생각지 못한 일이 생겼다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록2
QUEST_20171128_007006	Some demons were instantly scorched, some melted, yet others turned to stone: it was as if the lake was toxic, provoking all kinds of gruesome reactions on their bodies.{nl}Solcomm muttered under his breath. They had no way to know what was in that water until then.{nl}The entire lake could be seen and surveilled from the Astral Tower. There was even a large telescope at the top.	마치 부식액에 빠지기라도 한 듯, 난리가 난 것이다. 증상도 다양했는데 타는 녀석, 녹는 녀석, 굳는 녀석 제 각각이었다.{nl}솔콤은 나지막이 [보통 물이 아니었나..]라고 중얼거렸지만, 어차피 오늘의 첫 진격 전에는 그 사실을 알 수가 없었다. 별의 탑은 호수 전체를 조망할 수 있는 위치와 높이를 지녔고, 정상에는 거대한 망원경까지 있었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록2
QUEST_20171128_007007	Any recon operation, even in a small team, seemed impossible. Attempting one was accepting the almost sure chance of being discovered. There would be no turning back.	소수라고 하더라도 들키지 않고는 정찰이 불가능했다. 따라서 앞으로도 싸움에 나서는 모든 군대에 필수라는 전투전 사전 정찰이라는 기본이 되는 군사행동은 그야말로 물 건너로 가서 돌아오지 못할 상황이었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록2
QUEST_20171128_007008	Solcomm dismissed his head officer and gave his subordinates orders to retrieve a sample of lake water before retreating entirely. He had chosen to remain optimistic about his efforts.	솔콤은 선두에게 후퇴 명령과 함께 견본이 될 호숫물이나 떠오라는 지시를 내리고 첫 공격에서 간단히 물러섰다. 이 때까지만 해도 솔콤은 아직 낙관적인 기대를 지니고 있었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록2
QUEST_20171128_007009	Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 3	솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록3				
QUEST_20171128_007010	Investigating the lake water was futile. Perhaps they could have found a solution for a simpler kind of holy water, but this substance was much more complex. It had been created with not only magic, but alchemistic and theological knowledge far too advanced to decipher in such a short time.	호숫물을 살펴본 결과는 아무런 성과가 없었다. 단순히 여신들이 신성력을 쏟아 부은 성수였다면,해법이 있을 수도 있겠지만, 이것은 그렇게 간단한 것이 아니었다. 마법과 연금술 그리고 당대의 신학이 모두 동원되었으리라고 짐작될 뿐, 뚜렷한 해법이 보이지 않았다. 파헤치다 보면 해법이 나오겠지만, 당장은 어쩔 수 없었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록3
QUEST_20171128_007011	Observing the sacrifice of the first demons to come in contact with the lake taught them that it was part holy water, modified to react to demons and nothing else. They would have attempted to destroy the main devices powering the water's reaction, but getting to them involved passing through the lake's dangerous waters. Even without the interference of Schaffenstar's members, there was no way around it.	부하들을 희생한 추가 탐색에서 얻은 성과라면 일종의 성수반이라고 할 물체가 존재하고 거기서 나오는 액체가 호숫물에 섞여 마족에게만 해로운 인간이나 다른 동식물에게는 아무런 문제가 없는 괴상한 호숫물을 만든다는 사실이었다.{nl}그 수반 장치들을 다 파괴하면 언젠가는 호숫물의 농도가 낮아지다가 평범한 호숫물이 되겠지만, 곳곳에 산재한 시설은 샤펜스타 단원들의 방해가 없더라도 파괴가 쉽지 않았다. 발목 정도만 차는 물이라지만 젖지 않고는 접근할 방법이 없었기 때문이다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록3
QUEST_20171128_007012	 Solcomm certainly had his talented subordinates, but all Schaffenstar members were expert marksmen. Each demon would have been crossed by ten different arrows before they could even reach the lake's devices. Sure enough, even their most agile flying demons could not escape the tower's large ballista.	 솔콤은 부유하거나 나는 능력이 있는 부하들이 있었지만, 샤펜스타 단원들은 모두가 명사수였다.압도적인 숫자를 보내지 않는 한 수반시설에 접근하기도 전에 화살밥이 될 것이 틀림없었다.{nl}아니나 다를까 정찰을 위해 호수의 상공을 날던 비행형 마족들은 별의 탑에서 발사된 대형 노포의 공격을 받고 죽거나, 죽다 살아났다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록3
QUEST_20171128_007013	 Next, he attempted an attack by ship. Despite its shallow appearance, the Starfilled Lake hid in it an abyss of unknown depth. The Astral Tower had been magically built hovering above this abyss, with the path leading to the tower also constructed through magic means. The area containing the tower and its path had been built on floating magic stones, while the rest remained a normal lake. Solcomm's plan, then, was to attack the tower from the magic-free zones surrounding it.	 그래서 다음으로 시도한 것이 배를 이용하는 수상 공격이었다. 이 별깃든 호수라는 곳은 깊이를 알 수 없는 심연을 지닌 호수에 마법으로 탑을 세운 후 그 탑에 걸어서 접근할 수 있는 길을 역시 마법으로 만들었다. 이 길은 매우 넓어서 길이 아니라 광장이나 다른 명칭으로 불러도 될 정도였다.{nl} 하여간 이것들은 모두 마법으로 만들어진 석재로 이루어졌고, 마법의 힘으로 심연의 호수 위에 떠있었다. 넓은 호수의 절반 정도가 이런 부유 마법석으로 이루어진 지역 아니 수역이었고, 다른 지역은 그냥 호수였다. 따라서 부유 마법석이 없는 지역 아니 수역 위로 배를 띄워 탑을 공격해보겠다는 계획이었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록3
QUEST_20171128_007014	Unfortunately, obtaining the ships he needed wasn't as easy as planned. Even with F'vetta in charge of gathering ships and volunteers to sail them, their numbers fell short, so Solcomm resorted to secretly contacting Premier Eminent for help. Eminent had been gathering tremendous wealth in the human realm and was able to support their endeavour. Thus the demons could finally set sail on the Starfilled Lake.	그렇지만 배는 필요하다고 당장 뚝딱 만들어 낼 수 있는 물건이 아니었다.{nl}배를 준비하고 사는데 시간이 들었다. 프베타가 마계에서 배를 모으고, 그 배를 다룰 수 있는 마족을 수배해도 수가 부족해서 결국 비밀리에 프리미어 에미넌트에 접촉하였다. 그는 인간 세상에서 상당한 자금을 모아두고 있었는데 그것을 지원받아 인간들의 배도 사들여서 별깃든 호수로 날라왔다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록3
QUEST_20171128_007015	Sailing aboard the ships, the demons avoided contact with the water. They sailed for a few moments without signs of the enemy. The lake did not seem protected by any naval forces. Upon reaching a certain point in the lake, a downpour of arrows suddenly began to fall onto the demons' ships, piercing holes and splashing the lake's harmful water on their bodies. Unable to save the ships, the demons were helpless as water continued to infiltrate through the holes.	일단 배를 타니 호숫물에 부하들이 상하는 일은 없었다. 별의 탑에 딱히 수군이나 수상 병력이 있다는 낌새도 없었다.{nl}한참 접근할 때까지 공격도 없었다.{nl}그러나 아니나 다를까 별의 탑의 모습이 웬만큼 보이는 수상의 어느 장소에 도달하자 별의 탑에서 투사무기들이 사정없이 발사되었다.{nl}직접 맞지 않아도 물이 튀면 피해를 입었고, 정통으로 맞지 않고 빗맞아도 그 작은 파손 부위로 물이 새어 들기 시작했다.{nl}몸에 닿으면 피해를 입히니 퍼낼 방법도 없었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록3
QUEST_20171128_007016	The attack was not unforeseen, however. Solcomm had expected the occupants of the tower to fire their arsenal at his men; it was their most obvious means for defense.	하지만 솔콤이 멍청이라서 적에게 이런 강력한 원거리 투사무기가 있으리란 예상을 못하고 덤빈 것은 아니었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록3
QUEST_20171128_007017	Solcomm's goal was to determine whether his enemies on the lake in Astral Tower had other means of defense besides projectile weapons.{nl}After much sacrifice and enduring countless arrows and weapons fired by the Schaffenstar members, he managed to approach the tower. Convinced that he now understood every means of defense at the tower's disposal, Solcomm retreated his army.	솔콤의 목적은 별의 탑에 투사무기 말고 호수 수면 위의 적을 공격할 수단이 있는지 파악하는 것이었다.{nl}엄청난 희생을 무릅쓰고 별의 탑에 다가갔지만, 거리가 가까워지자 투사무기 외에 샤펜스타 단원들의 화살이 추가되긴 했어도, 다른 공격 수단이 없다는 사실은 확인할 수 있었다. 솔콤은 그 점을 확실히 확인하고 후퇴를 명령했다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록3
QUEST_20171128_007018	Even his flying monsters, which are normally capable of attacking rooftops and flying over the lake, were useless. However, Solcomm's attempt to approach the tower was not in vain.{nl}Now that he was assured that Astral Tower only protected itself with projectile weapons, he came up with a plan.	한편으로는 비행형 몬스터를 총동원하여 육상과 수상에서 동시에 접근해도 별의 탑에 도달할 수 없다는 점도 명확해졌다. 하지만 그렇게 뻔하게 예상되는 사실을 직접 확인하기 위해 배를 만들고 부하들을 희생한 것은 아니었다.{nl}그에게는 다음 계획이 있었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록3
QUEST_20171128_007019	Record of Solcomm's Attacks on the Astral Tower 4	솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4				
QUEST_20171128_007020	The area containing Astral Tower and the lake was later designated as under Schaffenstar's jurisdiction, but the people have been living there before that.{nl}Rather than the immediate area surrounding the tower, where battles could happen at any moment, people lived above the lake, which was fairly distant from the tower.{nl}Some parts of the village were built above magical levitation stones, which were placed by Schaffenstar, and other parts were built above boats and wooden structures.	훗날 국왕에 의해 정식으로 별의 탑과 그 인근 호수 부근이 샤펜스타의 관할로 인정되었지만, 그이전에도 호수를 기반으로 사는 주민들은 존재하였다.{nl}이들은 언제 전투가 벌어질지 알 수 없는 별의 탑 부근이 아닌 비교적 먼 거리의 호수 위에서 호상 촌락을 이루고 마을을 짓고 살았다.{nl}샤펜스타가 내준 거대한 마법부유석 위에 생긴 곳도 있고, 그냥 배와 나무를 이용해 물위에 지은 곳도 있었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4
QUEST_20171128_007021	These people were Solcomm's next target. He was certain that Schaffenstar would never let these people suffer. Based on recent battles, Solcomm figured that most ranged weapons in Astral Tower could not reach the lake village, and even if some magic attack reached the area, its effects would be greatly reduced. 	이들이 솔콤의 다음 목표이였다. 절대로 샤펜스타가 이들 주민을 수수방관할 수 없을 것이라고 생각했고, 별의 탑에서 발사되는 대부분 원거리 무기는 사정거리가 안 되고, 일부 마법 공격이 닿는다고 하여도 그 위력과 빈도가 줄어 견딜 수 있다고 지난 전투를 통해 판단했기 때문이다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4
QUEST_20171128_007022	After some sieges and scouting attempts, Solcomm learned this: Astral Tower is equipped with weapons that can strike down enemy ships. In order to make such defense possible, the lake was carefully divided into areas that have magical levitation stones to allow passage, as well as areas that were empty.{nl}Due to this, attacking the tower with ships was close to suicidal. It didn't matter whether the ships were filled with demons or humans. The ships would be destroyed.	이제까지의 공격과 탐색으로 알아낸 사실을 정리하면, 별의 탑은 배를 이용해 탑으로 접근하는 자들을 원거리에서 공격할 수 있는 시설이 있었고, 그런 시설이 가장 적절하게 활용될 수 있도록 그냥 호숫물이 있는 지역과 마법 부유석을 띄워 통행이 가능한 지역을 세심하게 배치하였다.{nl}그러므로 배를 이용한 수상에서의 공격은 자살 행위에 가까웠다. 그게 인간의 군대든 마족의 군대든 마찬가지였다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4
QUEST_20171128_007023	To Solcomm's surprise, no one seemed to know how deep the lake was. If any of the demons were to touch its water, they would melt and burn like acid.{nl}Solcomm previously sent his beast monsters and captured humans to scout underwater, but none returned. Finally, Solcomm decided to dive under the lake himself.	그리고 놀랍게도 이 호수는 육상에 있는 호수임에도 그 깊이를 누구도 알지 못했다.호숫물은 마계에 속한 자에게는 닿는 즉시 거의 부식액 수준의 효과를 일으켰다.{nl}솔콤은 포섭하거나 협박하여 부리고 있는 인간이나 야수 몬스터들에게 명령해 호수 깊은 곳을 탐색시켰지만, 아무도 돌아오지 못하자, 작심하고 직접 잠수를 하였다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4
QUEST_20171128_007024	However, even after swimming downward for five hours, he had to return without seeing the lake's bottom.{nl}The further he plunged, he encountered stranger and more aggressive creatures.{nl}When the armor he was wearing was punctured, the lake's water, which was fatal to demons, came pouring in. Solcomm almost died before coming ashore, and he had to give up scouting underwater. 	그러나 무려 다섯 시간이나 아래로 헤엄쳐 내려갔으나 결국 바닥을 보지 못한 채 돌아오고 말았다.{nl}아래로 내려갈수록 호수에 사는 기이한 어류들이 더 자주 공격해왔고, 더 강한 놈들이 나타났다.{nl}마침내 준비한 방어복이 그 중 하나에게 찢기자 마족에게 치명적인 호숫물이 스며들기 시작했고, 그로 인한 고통을 참으며 겨우 수면까지 부상하느라 거의 죽을 뻔한 후, 호수 아래에 대한 관심은 접었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4
QUEST_20171128_007025	It is a surprise that fishermen living above the lake paid taxes to Schaffenstar, the governing body of Astral Tower, and received protection in return.{nl}Although it wasn't designated as such by the king yet, Lydia Schaffen and her Schaffenstar were basically the rulers of the lake.{nl}The people living above and around the lake were proud of serving Lydia Schaffen, a legendary hero, and the Schaffenstar members were fair and just in their ruling. Other than some big cities, no place was safer than this lake.	그런데 이상한 일은 이 호수에서 어업을 하는 어민들이 있고, 이들은 별의 탑의 주인인 샤펜스타에게 세금을 내는 한편으로는 보호를 받았다.{nl}아직 정식으로 국왕의 인정을 받지는 않았지만, 리디아 샤펜 혹은 그녀가 세운 샤펜스타라는 단체는 사실상 이 지역의 영주나 다름없고, 호수 전체는 그 영지인 셈이었다.{nl}호수를 기반으로 사는 사람들은 자신들의 통치자가 전설적인 영웅 리디아 샤펜이라는 사실을 엄청난 자랑으로 알았고, 샤펜스타 역시 관대하고 공정하게 그들을 다스렸다.{nl}실은 통치자라기 보다는 보호자에 가깝다고 봐야 했다. 대도시가 아닌 지역 중에 여기만큼 몬스터로부터 안전한 인간의 거주지는 없었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4
QUEST_20171128_007026	Whenever there were monsters near the area, the Schaffenstar members were immediately deployed to shoot them down.{nl}However, with a large demon army such as Solcomm's, things went a bit differently.{nl}Without full-on battles outside the tower, the area's villagers couldn't be protected.{nl}Also, even if the Schaffenstar members were all elite marksmen, fighting in the open is nothing like firing arrows from an impregnable tower.	이제까지는 샤펜스타 단원들이 출현하는 몬스터가 있으면 출동하여 즉각 즉각 사살하였기 때문에 그랬다.{nl}그러나 대규모 마족의 군대가 있는 지금은 그런 식으로는 해결이 되지 않는다.{nl}탑 외부에서 전면전을 고려하지 않고는 주민들을 보호할 수 없다.{nl}그리고 샤펜스타가 아무리 대단한 궁수들의 집단이라고 해도 별의 탑이라는 난공불락의 요새에서 화살을 날리는 것과 탁 트인 호수에서 싸우는 것은 전혀 다른 문제다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4
QUEST_20171128_007027	Generally speaking, archers need either distance or height to gain a combat advantage. Otherwise, they become easy targets for enemy infantry and cavalry. Solcomm knew that even the famous Schaffenstar wouldn't be able to overcome these limits.	대개 궁병이란 높이와 거리를 둘 중 하나를 확보하지 못하면 보병 혹은 기병의 먹이가 되는 법이고, 솔콤은 설령 샤펜스타라고 해도 그 사실에서 벗어날 수 없다고 생각했다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4
QUEST_20171128_007028	The problem was luring them out. Solcomm's plan was to attack the lake village to force Schaffenstar to come out of their tower.{nl}Right after Solcomm began his attacks, the entrance to the village was shut tight.{nl}Although it wasn't much, it was enough to make it very inconvenient for demons to approach though the lake's fatal water.{nl}However, tearing down its wooden barriers would be a simple task with enough ships.{nl}Solcomm was certain that Schaffenstar would have to come out if that happened.	문제는 상대를 끌어내는 일인데 호상 마을을 습격하면 안 나오고 버티지 못하리라고 솔콤은 생각했다.{nl}솔콤이 공격을 시작하자 마을은 거주지의 문을 닫아 걸었다.{nl}대단하지는 않지만, 일단은 고립된 호수의 섬마을이 되는 형세라, 마족에게는 치명적인 호숫물 때문에 접근과 공격이 불편하기는 했다.{nl}그러나 배를 탄 상태에서 포위하고 두드리면 돌벽이 아닌 목책을 깨는 일은 시간문제였다.{nl}샤펜스타 단원들이 주민을 구하기 위해 안 나오고 배기겠냐고 생각했다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4
QUEST_20171128_007029	However, it never happened.{nl}In fact, there was no need.	그런데 나오지 않았다.{nl}그리고 나올 필요도 없었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4
QUEST_20171128_007030	Tornadoes suddenly appeared.{nl}It was merely a lake, but the tornados' scale was overwhelmingly huge.{nl}Solcomm couldn't help but stare at it.	 용오름이라니{nl}바다도 아니고 호수에서 이런 정도의 용오름이라..{nl}솔콤은 저도 모르게 입을 벌리고야 말았다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4
QUEST_20171128_007031	Although the lake was considerable large, and tornadoes can occur on land, the occurrence itself was quite baffling.{nl}When tornadoes appear precisely above attacking ships, this doesn't happen by chance.{nl}Frankly, these tornadoes were so precise in their positioning, that they kept circling the village.{nl}Whenever these tornadoes barely touched Solcomm's ships, they were overturned, throwing helpless demons into the lake in the process.{nl}Although some ships managed to avoid these tornadoes, the lake's fatal water was sprayed all over the ships.	호수가 엄청 크긴 하고 용오름이란 것이 꼭 물에서만 일어나는 것이 아니라 땅에서도 일어나기도 하는 것이니 거기까지는 이해할 수 있었다.{nl}그러나 꼭 배가 있는 지점을 정확히 집어서 일어나는 용오름은 절대로 자연적인 것일 리가 없었다.{nl}솔직히 용오름이 정확히 거주지 둘레에서만 동시다발적으로 그것도 계속 끊임없이 일어나는 것 자체가 절대로 자연현상이 아니란 증거였다.{nl}용오름에 배가 뒤집히면 부하들이 물에 빠졌고, 빠지면 살아남지 못했다.{nl} 배가 뒤집히지 않아도 용오름은 호숫물을 말아 올려 사방으로 뿌렸고, 그것을 맞으면 부하들이 무사할 수 없었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4
QUEST_20171128_007032	This didn't happen when the demons were attacking the tower itself.{nl}It could be deduced that Schaffenstar wasn't trying to hide their capability of summoning tornadoes, but rather, built villages in places where tornadoes could be summoned in the first place.{nl}Sadly, for Solcomm, this deduction was correct.{nl}Solcomm had to retreat without getting to see a single arrow, let alone Schaffenstar members.	별의 탑을 공격할 때는 이런 것이 없었다.{nl}추측하자면 일부러 숨기고 안 썼다기 보다는 사용 가능한 위치와 조건이 한정되어 있으니 그것을 사용할 수 있는 위치에다 마을을 지으라고 했다는 것이 타당한 결론이었다.{nl}그리고 솔콤에게는 불행히도 그 추측은 사실이기도 했다.{nl}솔콤은 결국 샤펜스타의 단원은 고사하고 화살 하나 구경 못하고 후퇴를 명해야 했다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록4

QUEST_20171128_007034	His next plan was to hire human mercenaries.{nl}Strategically, it was much better to create an army containing both demons and human mercenaries, but even the greediest mercenaries weren't too keen on fighting alongside demons.{nl}Solcomm even had to disguise himself as a human to get them to sign the contracts in the first place.	다음으로 추진한 방법은 인간의 용병을 고용하는 방법이었다.{nl}좋기로는 마족과 인간 용병의 연합군을 구성하면 전술적으로 좋겠지만, 아무리 돈이면 다하는 용병이라도 마족과 함께 어깨를 맞대고 싸우는 일을 아무렇지도 않게 여길 사람은 없었다.{nl}심지어 계약 자체를 마족이 아닌 인간의 모습으로 위장해 해야 했다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록5
QUEST_20171128_007035	Even then, most mercenaries, who were initially interested in offered payment, refused to attack peaceful villagers.{nl}Even the crazier ones who were willing to attack the innocent would look at Solcomm in disbelief after learning that Lydia Schaffen will be their foe.	그러나 제시한 거액에 관심을 보이고 달려든 용병들도 상대가 전투원이 아니라 일반 주민이란 말을 들으면 고개를 저었다.{nl}혹시 그 단계를 넘어도 장소가 별깃든 호수고 리디아 샤펜과 적대를 해야 한다는 말을 들으면 별 미친 놈 다 보겠다 라는 태도를 보이고 떠났다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록5
QUEST_20171128_007036	Furthermore, one of the mercenaries reported to the royal officers of these recruiting efforts, causing government officials to start searching for suspicious people looking to hire mercenaries.{nl}This prevented any mercenaries from joining Solcomm.	그리고 그 중에 누군가가 신고를 해서 결국에는 왕국 관리들이 별의 탑에 수상한 짓을 하려는 자들이 용병을 구한다는 일에 대해 수사에 나섰다.{nl}그러자 아예 나서는 자가 전혀 없게 되었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록5
QUEST_20171128_007037	To make matters worse, F'vetta, who has been supporting Solcomm by traveling between the demonic world and the human world, reported Solcomm's mistakes to Demon Queen Gesti, causing him to be summoned and scolded. After this incident was spread within the underworld, other demon lords and queens started to look down upon Solcomm, causing his position in the underworld to fall even further.	게다가 마계와 인간 세상을 오가며 그를 보조하던 프베타가 그 사실을 상부에 보고해서 솔콤은 마왕 제스티에게 불려가 호되게 혼까지 났다.{nl}제스티는 마족이 인간을 의지하는 행위를 싫어했고, 이 일이 알려지자 제스티뿐만 아니라 다른 마왕들에까지 미운털이 박혀서 마계에서 그의 입지만 더 좁아졌다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록5
QUEST_20171128_007038	Although Solcomm gave a warning to F'vetta for her reports, doing so was her job, so he couldn't just blame everything on her.{nl}At least, it was a relief to him that Lydia Schaffen and her Schaffenstar haven't warned others of the attack, let alone ask for reinforcements. However, this was likely due to Schaffenstar's pride and their level of preparation for the attack.	 솔콤은 프베타에게 주의를 주긴 했지만, 프베타로서는 더 높은 상급자에게 보고를 안 할 수 없는 일이었으니 마냥 나무랄 수도 없었다.{nl}아직은 솔콤의 침공에 대해 리디아 샤펜과 그녀가 이끄는 샤펜스타가 외부에 지원 요청도 않고, 심지어 알리지도 않은 점이 그나마 다행이지만, 그것은 어쩌면 샤펜의 자부심과 그 자부심에 걸맞은 준비를 했기 때문일 수 있었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록5
QUEST_20171128_007039	Solcomm did not know this at the time, but Lydia Schaffen didn't ask for help because the tower must be prepared to withstand attacks without any support from the royal army or militia for centuries to come.{nl}She was very much aware that someone like King Kadumel could rise to power at any moment to unite the demons with humans. Kings like Kadumel will undoubtedly try to seize the secrets contained in Astral tower, and the tower must be able to stand tall when that happens.{nl}Sadly, Solcomm was destined to slowly learn this over the next couple of centuries.	실은 이 시점에서는 솔콤은 몰랐지만, 향후 몇 세기의 시간 동안 외부의 지원 없이 탑이 버틸 수 있어야 하기 때문에 리디아 샤펜은 애초부터 왕국의 공식적 지원이든 민간인의 원조가 있으면 좋겠지만, 그것을 기대해선 안 된다는 사실을 잘 알고 있었다.{nl}심지어 리디아 샤펜은 그녀가 경험한 카듀멜 국왕 같은 작자가 앞으로 또 나와 심지어 왕국군과 마족이 연합하여 탑과 그에 담긴 계시를 탈취하려는 상황도 견뎌낼 수 있어야 한다는 점을 염두에 두고 있었다.{nl}솔콤은 이후 몇 백 년의 세월 동안 이 사실을 뼈저리게 느낄 운명이었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록5

QUEST_20171128_007041	If we were to use force, we should have done it before the tower was complete, was Solcomm's conclusion. Even so, Solcomm had no other choice but to resort to an all-out attack. He couldn't just ignore the criticisms from his superiors, so he had to push on. Also, he had to try at least once.	‘힘으로 하려면 탑이 완성되기 전에 그리 했어야 했었다’고 솔콤은 생각했다. 그렇게 생각하면서도 솔콤은 결국 총공세를 택할 수밖에 없었다. 인간 용병을 사려는 태도가 마계 상급자들의 강력한 비판을 받은 뒤라 강경책을 쓸 필요가 있었다. 그리고 그것이 아니더라도 한 번 정도는 해보지 않을 수 없는 방법이기도 했다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007042	While being very much aware that Schaffenstar will not lower their defenses, Solcomm kept his force from making hasty attacks, and gathered even more demons by pushing F'vetta.{nl}After Solcomm's failures were spread in the demonic world, F'vetta's job of recruiting demons became much more difficult, and she made sure to let Solcomm know of her difficulties.{nl}However, Solcomm was ready to push himself to  the end for the last time.	그럴 리 없다고 생각은 하면서도 별의 탑의 샤펜스타가 경계심이 무뎌지길 바라면서, 쓸데없는 도발로 부하들을 희생하지 않고 꾸준히 병력을 모으고 프베타를 혹사시켜 마계에서 마족들을 모집하거나 징병해서 수를 늘렸다.{nl}마계에 솔콤이 마왕들에게서 야단을 맞았다는 소문이 퍼지면서 프베타가 병력과 자원을 조달하는 일이 어렵다는 불만사항을 자주 토로하기도 했다.{nl}그래도 최대한 힘을 모아서 안 해 볼 수 없는 것이 전력을 기울이는 총공세이다. 그리고 솔콤도 이번만큼은 갈 때까지 가볼 마음을 먹고 있었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007043	For more than six months, Solcomm prepared for his all-out attack. He didn't have enough flying demons, nor enough ships, but he had to make do by approaching the tower through the lake. 	그렇게 반 년이 넘게 총공격을 준비하였다. 비행 가능한 마족이 많이 부족하고, 배를 더 구하기 어려워 수상에서의 공격은 포기하여 대부분 육로?로 접근할 수밖에 없었지만, 그래도 달리 방법이 없었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007044	The magical levitation stones were floating in a way that shallow water still flowed over them. It was too shallow for boats, and still too deep for demons to cross.{nl}Lydia Schaffen made sure these stones were floating at the exact heights to make this possible. This also made Schaffenstar members' shoes wet all the time, but for demons, it was a deadly threat.	이 호수의 부유석은 정말 절묘한 높이로 물에 떠 있어서 발목 밖에 안차는 물은 마족에게 충분히 해로우면서도 그 정도 수심으로는 배를 띄울 수 없기에 배를 이용할 길은 막아버렸다.{nl}리디아 샤펜은 호숫물의 수위가 항상 그 발목 정도로 유지되도록 마법 부유석이 떠있는 높이를 조절하였다. 이것은 샤펜스타 단원들에게는 항상 신발이 젖어있는 불편함의 문제였지만, 마족에게는 치명적인 문제가 되었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007045	When there weren't any battles or training during the day, Schaffenstar's recruits removed moss and water plants from the stones with rakes.{nl}After that, they carefully walked to the edge and tossed the plants in the lake.{nl}These tossed plants eventually became food for creatures living in the lake, leading countless creatures to be gathered around the floating stones.	 전투나 전투 훈련이 없는 때면 샤펜스타의 수습단원들이 갈퀴 같은 도구 등을 들고 나와 저절로 자라는 바닥의 이끼나 물풀 등을 뜯어냈다.{nl}이들은 마법 부유석의 가장 자리까지 조심스레 나간 다음, 뜯어서 모은 풀과 수초 흙 따위를 호수에 버렸다.{nl}그러면 호수의 여러 수생 동물들이 그 풀을 먹기 위해 모였고, 나중에는 언제 떨어질지 모르는 풀을 먹기 위해 가장 자리에는 항상 모여있게 되었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007046	Schaffenstar recruits were strictly trained and taught where the edges were, and where it was safe to walk, because there was no end to the lake's depth.{nl}Their daily routine of removing plants was also helpful in drilling this information into their minds. Of course, seniors were always nearby to make sure absolutely no recruits accidently fell in the lake.	 샤펜스타의 신입단원들은 그래서 항상 어디까지가 걸어 다닐 수 있는 마법부유석 지역이고 어디서부터가 한 걸음 내디디면 끝을 알 수 없는 호수심연의 바로 위인지를 입단할 때 철저히 교육받았다.{nl}그리고 수습단원 시절에 하는 이 물풀제초 작업을 통해 풀을 모아 버리는 과정에서 그 위치를 더 확실히 기억하였다. 물론 어떤 초보 단원이 실수로 물에 빠지거나 하지 않도록 노련한 선배들이 작업을 감독하는 것은 당연한 일이었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007047	Such accidents were much more fatal than one would think.{nl}As mentioned before, creatures were always gathered around the edges of these stones.{nl}These creatures may seem harmless from above, but if someone were to fall over the edge, they would attack that person without any hesitation. A fall into the lake was almost impossible to survive.{nl}This was one of the biggest reasons that made attacking the tower from the lake very difficult.{nl}If the boats were to sink, the demons didn't have anywhere to swim to.{nl}Although they were strong enough to swim to the edges of these stones, those were the most dangerous places.	 가장자리에서 물에 빠지는 사고는 생각 이상으로 위험하였다.{nl}왜냐하면 이미 말했듯이 그곳에서 버려지는 수초를 먹기 위해 호수의 수생 동물들이 모여있기 때문이었다.{nl}이들은 가장 자리를 밟고 있을 때는 위협이 되지 않지만, 누군가 물에 빠지면 사정없이 공격하였고, 이 공격에서 살아남는 일은 무척 어려웠다.{nl}이러한 공격은 별의 탑을 수상에서 공격하는 일을 어렵게 만드는 다른 이유이기도 했다.{nl}이런 생물들 탓에 수상 공격시 배가 부서졌다면, 비록 마족이 아니라서 헤엄칠 수 있다고 하더라도 상륙할 곳이 없어지기 때문이었다.{nl}수영을 잘 하고 체력이 좋아서 가장자리까지 올 수 있었다 해도 그곳이야 말로 가장 위험한 장소이기 때문이다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007048	The parts of the lake that didn't have any magical levitation stones over them were much safer.{nl}Of course, this would only be true until the demons become exhausted from swimming and sunk below.{nl}However, the villagers under protection of Schaffenstar were mostly safe in these areas. You see, the plants that were fed to them weren't intended to be food, but rather, highly addictive substances.{nl}This was one of Lydia's defensive strategies.	따라서 마법부유석이 없는 수역은 마법부유석 주변의 가장자리보다 중심이 더 안전했다.{nl}나중에 체력이 다해 가라앉기 전까지만 그렇겠지만 말이다.{nl}샤펜스타단의 보호를 받는 주민들은 이 점에서도 안전했는데, 호수의 흉포한 생물들이 샤펜스타가 주는 풀을 먹는 것은 먹이로 먹는 것이 아니기 때문이었다.{nl}애초에 그들은 육식성이지만, 리디아 샤펜이 면밀히 세운 장기간의 방어 전략에 따라 생존에 필요 없는 수초에 중독되도록 만들었기 때문이었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007049	Because of their addiction, most of the aggressive and carnivorous creatures stayed around these edges, and other fish could safely breed and grow their numbers. This hugely benefited the fishermen of the village.{nl}Although carnivorous creatures would sometimes return to the lake's center to find their prey, they would immediately return to the edges for more plants afterward.{nl}The fishermen ran into these creatures occasionally, but they always carried some dried water plants to toss in the water.	따라서 어민들은 흉포한 어류가 없는 중심 부근의 수역에서 육식성 어류가 없어서 엄청나게 번식한 물고기 등을 풍족하게 잡을 수 있었다.{nl}육식성의 수생 생물들은 정 배가 고파지면 그곳으로 와서 작은 물고기 등을 잡아 먹곤 했지만, 어느 정도 배가 차면 즉시 가장자리로 돌아가곤 했다.{nl}물론 가끔은 어민과 조우할 수도 있지만, 위급한 경우를 대비해 지니도록 한 수초 마른 덩어리를 멀리 던지면 그것을 따라가기 때문에 어민들이 위험한 경우는 없었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007050	However, tossing these plants in the wrong places could lead to fatal accidents, so the Schaffenstar members warned the fishermen to do this only when necessary.{nl}In the end, since most of these plants were tossed near the edges, the most dangerous creatures just stayed there rather than chasing the fishermen.	다만 샤펜스타 단원들은 수중 몬스터가 수초 때문에 어민을 노리지 않도록 가능한 자제를 요구했고, 어민들도 매우 위급한 경우에만 사용하여 그 통제를 따랐다.{nl}무엇보다 수초는 가장 자리에서 쏟아지는 양이 훨씬 많기 때문에 수중 몬스터들 역시 그 습성을 바꾸기 어려웠다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007051	All of these factors guaranteed that the walkable surfaces were kept clean.{nl}These clean surfaces were soon tainted by Solcomm and his minions during their march toward the Astral Tower.	그러므로 사람이 딛고 설 수 있는 호수 부분은 항상 깨끗한 상태를 유지하고 있었다.{nl}그 깨끗한 바닥을 통해 솔콤의 부하들이 호수를 통해 별의 탑으로 진격하면서 돌과 바위를 던져 그 위를 밟으며 앞으로 나갔다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007052	They brought vast amounts of soil to pour over the stones, which made it safe for the demons to march.{nl}It is a textbook tactic to fill moats that surround castles, but in this case, the whole lake functioned as one giant moat. A siege that involved filling a whole lake like this was unprecedented.{nl}Thankfully for the demons, the water was shallow enough where they were, but they still had a long way to go.{nl}Also, they had to cover a wide surface to avoid incoming arrows from the tower.	엄청난 흙을 날라와 부으면서 한 걸음씩 앞으로 나갔다.{nl}농성전의 기본은 성 주위를 두른 해자를 메우는 일이지만, 호수 전체가 그 해자인 상황에서는 호수 전체를 메워야 하는 황당한 상황은 역사에 유례가 없는 것이었다.{nl}다행히 발목에 겨우 차는 물이라 한 걸음 디딜 자리를 만드는 것은 어렵지 않지만 탑에 이르기까지 건널 호수의 거리와 폭은 매우 멀고 넓었다.{nl}다수의 병력이 넓게 퍼져서 진격하지 않으면 별의 탑에서 쏟아지는 투사 무기의 좋은 표적밖에는 안 된다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007053	Despite their fierce march, a whole day has passed without a single battle.{nl}This was peculiar, but expected at the same time. The demons were busy filling the lake to make paths, and they kept out of Astral Tower's catapult's reach.{nl}Even Lydia Schaffen was limited by her weapons' range.	 기세 좋게 공격 명령을 내렸는데 아무런 전투 행위가 일어나지 않고 만 하루가 꼬박 지나갔다.{nl}이는 이상한 일이지만 당연한 일이기도 했는데 마족들은 호수 위에 발붙인 공간을 만드느라 정신이 없었고,아직은 별의 탑의 투사무기들이 닿는 사정거리 밖의 공사였다.{nl}아무리 리디아 샤펜이라도 별의 탑에 배치할 수 있는 장거리 노포의 수와 사정거리는 한정될 수밖에 없었기 때문이다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007054	Because the area above the magical levitation stones were actually safe from the Astral Tower's defensive weapons,{nl}all Schaffenstar had to do was place guards on the tower and observe their slow progress. The typical process of pouring arrows upon attackers' siege attempts wasn't going to happen for a while.	때문에 마법 부유석으로 이루어진 수역은 별의 탑에서 멀리 떨어져 있으면 장거리 공격에서는 안전했다.{nl}샤펜스타로서는 탑에 감시병을 세우고 뻔히 보이는 공사 현황을 살피기만 하면, 휴식을 취하고 있어도 무방했다. 때문에 고래로 적이 성밖의 해자를 메우려 들면 성 위에서는 공성군을 향해 온갖 공격을 쏟아내는 전통적인 전투의 양식은 실종되었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007055	On the second day, it finally happened.{nl}Solcomm's army finally reached the tower's attack range.{nl}Right after this, Schaffenstar members fired all sorts of projectiles above demons' heads, which reached much further than what humans' weapons are normally capable of. While the projectiles were flying over them, the demons had no choice but to keep filling the lake.	진격을 개시한 다음 날이 돼서야 그러한 전통적 공격이 시작되었다.{nl}솔콤의 부하들의 공사가 진척되어 사정거리 안으로 들어섰기 때문이다.{nl}샤펜스타 단원들이 멀리 호수 중심에 서있는 별의 탑에서 인간이 만든 것이라고 하기엔 믿을 수 없는 사정거리를 지닌 노포 등의 공격을 마족들 머리 위로 떨어뜨렸다. 솔콤의 부하들은 그 공격에 아무런 반격도 못하고 바닥을 메우는 일만 할 수밖에 없었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007056	Siege towers with roofs were brought to minimize the damage, but even such structures would fall to the continuous stream of projectiles.{nl}One positive outcome from all this was that the thrown rocks could be utilized to fill more parts of the lake.{nl}Because the Astral Tower was built on top of a lake, most traditional siege weapons were rendered useless.{nl}For example, digging tools for sieges couldn't be used, even if demons were capable of digging underwater.	 지붕이 있는 공성탑 등을 미리 장만하여 그 안에서 작업을 하여 피해를 최대한 줄이기는 했지만,그런 장비도 계속되는 공격에는 부서지기 마련이었다.{nl}그나마 위안이 있다면 그런 장비를 부수기 위해 샤펜스타 단원들이 투석기에서 날린 바위들을 그나마 공사에 활용할 수 있다는 점이었다.{nl}별의 탑은 물위에 지어졌기 때문에 다른 공성전에서 사용할 수 있는 많은 선택지가 사라졌다.{nl}예를 들어 전통적으로 공성전에 쓰이는 땅굴파기 같은 것은 설령 물속에 굴을 파는 재주가 있어도 여기서는 쓸 수 없었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007057	Solcomm was indeed aware of the fact that Lydia Schaffen would be fully prepared for him.{nl}If his enemy was the lake, he was even prepared to bring an army the size of an ocean to swallow that lake. He was under that much pressure from by his superiors.	물론 리디아 샤펜이 별의 탑을 지으면서 농성전 상황 같은 기본적인 준비를 안 했을 리가 없다는 점은 솔콤도 익히 생각하고 있었다.{nl}적이 호수라면 자신은 바다처럼 많은 마족과 몬스터를 동원해서라도 이겨야 한다고 생각하였다. 무엇보다 마계의 상급자들이 그런 압박을 그에게 주고 있었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007058	Unfortunately, for Solcomm, his army was progressing at an excruciatingly slow speed, and its number was becoming smaller by the minute.{nl}Most demons and monsters love to fight, and are used to desperate situations.{nl}However, this was something else. All they did was staring at their feet while being attacked. Unsurprisingly, complaints began pouring out.{nl}Dying in a proper battle was much more preferable, and they are much more controllable during battles.	 그러나 얇은 물을 메우며 진격하는 속도는 더디기만 했고, 피해는 늘어만 갔다.{nl}피해가 늘어도 싸움을 좋아하는 마족과 흉폭한 몬스터라면 불만이 없었던 것이 그간 마계의 성향이었다.{nl}그러나 이곳의 상황은 달랐다. 화끈하게 싸우지는 못하고 물바닥만 쳐다보고 있는데 피해가 나오니 하급 마족들의 불만이 마구 터져 나왔다.{nl}차라리 정말 강한 적과 맞서 싸우면서 죽어나가는 상황이라면 어지간한 경우 마족의 성향상 통제가 가능하다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007059	However, Solcomm's minions quickly grew tired doing nothing against the arrows and stones that were flying toward them.{nl}Even F'vetta's discontent toward Solcomm was growing.	 그러나 적의 모습은 구경도 못하고 적의 투사 무기나 투석 그리고 화살 말고는 보는 것이 없는 상황에서 솔콤을 향한 하급자들의 불만은 커져만 갔다.{nl}프베타 역시 말은 안 하지만, 솔콤을 보좌하면서 점점 불만이 쌓이고 있는 모양이었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007060	Despite all this, his army finally reached the tower's entrance.{nl}Flying demons, who were occupied in shooting down the projectiles, could finally focus on attacking the tower.{nl}Although some demons had to keep filling the lake, the rest could march straight over the small amount of water. Finally, after several days have passed, they would have their proper battle.	 그래도 결국 시간이 흘러 공격의 선두가 별의 탑 입구를 코앞에 두는 상황이 되었다.{nl}이제까지 날아오는 투석 따위를 공중에서 요격해 방향을 바꿔 마족의 피해를 줄이는 일에 힘쓰던 비행 마족들을 본격적인 전투에 들어가도록 하고,{nl}일부는 메우기 작업에 남기면서도 많은 마족을 얼마 안 남은 거리는 물을 밟아 피해를 입더라도 돌진하라는 명령을 내려 총공격을 시작한 지 며칠 만에 겨우 총공세다운 총공격을 할 때가 왔다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007061	 Of course, streams of boiling water, stones, arrows, fire, and magic started pouring over the demons' heads when they got close enough. Most of the flying demons were hit by arrows soon after the battle began, and they fell on parts of the lake that weren't filled.{nl}Although it seemed like Solcomm was fighting a losing battle, it was still a battle.	 당연히 별의 탑에서는 아래를 향해 끓는 물, 투석, 화살, 화염, 각종 마법을 쏟아부었다. 공중에서 공격하는 마족들도 샤펜스타 단원들의 화살을 맞고 호수에 떨어져 가라앉거나 부유석에 떨어져도 그곳이 진격하면서 메운 곳이 아니면 호숫물에 피해를 입고 결국 절명했다.{nl}전황은 조금도 유리하지 않았지만, 그래도 솔콤측으로서는 처음으로 싸움다운 싸움을 하는 셈이었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007062	Solcomm was ready to fight to his death, no matter the outcome. All of his demons were already on the lake, and Solcomm himself charged in front of his minions.{nl}Despite popular belief, there is no such thing as an impregnable castle.{nl}Even if all the siege attempts had failed, the defenders are bound to run out of resources without help from allies to attack the surrounding army. Sturdy weaponry and catapults are only there to buy enough time for that to happen. Whether you were on the attacking side, or the defending side, the side who is able to hold out wins.	 솔콤은 설령 이 공성전에서 이기든 전멸하든 끝장을 볼 생각이었다. 이미 모든 병력이 호수의 수역내로 진입한 상황이었고, 자신도 앞장 서 공격에 나섰다.{nl}농성전에서 난공불락의 성이란 없다는 것은 불변의 사실이었다.{nl}다른 요소가 없다면 일반적으로는 농성자는 결국 물자가 떨어져서 지게 된다.{nl}농성자들의 승리는 적절한 시기에 구원병이 도착하거나 외부에 아군이 있어서 지속적으로 포위자를 괴롭힌 끝에 인내심의 싸움에서 이기는 것이지 방어설비의 단단함은 시간을 벌어주는 기능이 전부다. 그리고 그 시간을 견디지 못하는 측이 패하는 것이다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007063	Knowing this, Solcomm kept encouraging his demons.{nl}But then, when he looked over his head, he saw Lydia Schaffen herself, aiming an arrow at his head.{nl}It almost looked as if she was waiting for Solcomm to see her aiming at him.	솔콤은 그렇게 믿고 싸움을 독려하였다.{nl}그 때 갑자기 솔콤은 불길한 예감을 느끼고, 위를 올려다 보다가 리디아 샤펜이 별의 탑의 한 망루 난간에서 자신에게 활을 겨누고 있는 것을 발견하였다.{nl}한참 동안 그러고 있으면서 솔콤이 뭔가를 느끼고 그녀를 보기를 기다렸던 것 같았다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007064	At that moment, Solcomm immediately recognized the weapon she was holding. It was the bow that killed the Demon Lord Ghibulinas.{nl}A single arrow would be enough to kill Solcomm.{nl}Solcomm was well aware that she would be able to hit him with her arrow if he charged in front.{nl}Despite this, he had to do this to silence the resentment from his minions and superiors.	솔콤은 그녀가 쥔 활과 화살이 바로 마왕 지부리나스를 죽인 그 무기라는 사실을 바로 알 수 있었다.{nl}한 발로 자신의 숨통을 끊을 수 있는 화살이다.{nl} 솔콤도 리디아 샤펜이 자신을 저격할 수 있기 때문에 선두에 서는 일이 위험하다는 점을 알고 있었다.{nl}그러나 그렇게라도 하지 않으면 부하부터 상급자까지 마족들의 팽배한 불만을 누를 길이 없다고 판단해 나선 것이었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007065	He could withstand the scolding from Gesti, but if she sent him back to Kartas, there would be no telling what he would do to Solcomm as punishment.{nl}Being tortured by Kartas was much worse than being killed by Lydia's arrows.	제스티에게 불려가는 일까지는 견딜 수 있겠지만, 만약 제스티가 카르타스에게 자신을 도로 보내면 카르타스는 실패에 대한 문책으로 솔콤에게 무슨 짓을 할지 알 수 없었다.{nl}카르타스의 장난감이 되어 고문을 받느니 차라리 리디아 샤펜의 화살에 맞아 죽는 것이 나았다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007066	However, her arrow never came. Instead, she withdrew her arrow and said this: [Fools! You are standing over stones that are controlled with magic.]{nl}Her words could be clearly heard by Solcomm who was still quite far away.{nl}However, he did not understand the meaning behind her words. He was about to find out.	 솔콤이 리디아 샤펜을 주시했음에도 그녀는 화살을 쏘지 않았다. 도리어 그녀는 화살을 거두더니 이렇게 말했다. [멍청아. 너희들이 딛고 서 있는 것은 마법으로 물에 띄운 석재구조물이라고.]{nl}그 말은 먼 거리에도 불구하고 솔콤 같은 마군주에게는 명확히 들렸다.{nl}하지만 그 의미는 명확하지 않았다. 그러나 다음 순간 그 의미는 설명할 필요도 없이 몸으로 느낄 수 있었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007067	At that moment, the stones that Solcomm's army was standing on started trembling, and soon after, they started to sink below the lake.{nl}Even demons who generally remain calm in times of chaos started screaming.{nl}Water started pouring over the stones and burned every demon that was on them.{nl}Solcomm couldn't do anything but watch his minions burn and melt in water.{nl}It was then Solcomm finally realized that Lydia was waiting for his entire army to move on to the lake.{nl}The distance his army had to run would take days.{nl}Even his flying minions had to avoid rains of arrows to retreat.	발이 떨리는 느낌이 들더니 바닥 전체가 아래로 침강하고 있었다.{nl}어지간한 일에는 꿈쩍도 하지 않는 마족 중에도 비명을 지르는 자가 있을 정도였다.{nl}사방에서 물이 쏟아져 들어오면서 마족들을 녹이고 불태웠다.{nl}물속에서 불에 타올라 죽어가는 부하들을 보면서 솔콤은 할 수 있는 일이 없었다.{nl}그제야 상대가 적이 충분히 들어올 때까지 기다렸다는 사실을 알 수 있었다.{nl}공격은 커녕 빠져나가는 거리가 시간이나 분단위가 아니라 날짜 단위로 세야 하는 곳에 있었다.{nl}날거나 부유하는 능력이 있더라도 화살 공격을 받으며 벗어나야 했다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007068	When only a handful of demons made it out, F'vetta arrived with additional demons from the demonic world.{nl}Because Solcomm was too shocked to do anything, F'vetta calmed the survivors in his stead.	소수와 간신히 살아나왔을 때 마계에서 추가로 데려온 마족들을 이끌고 프베타가 도착하였다.{nl}그리고 넋이 나간 솔콤을 대신해 생존자들을 수습하고 새로 끌고 마족들이 동요하기 않도록 달랬다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007069	Based on the report made by F'vetta after this incident, these magical levitation stones cannot be raised or lowered easily.{nl}According to experts on magic, if the stones were moved like this once, it would take decades before being able to do so again.	프베타가 그 후 조사하여 한 보고에 의하면, 마법부유석을 위아래로 움직이거나 위치를 바꾸는 일은 별의 탑에서도 무척 부담스러운 일로 자주 할 수 없다고 하였다.{nl}한 번 사용하면 몇 십 년은 다시 마력을 충전을 해야 사용할 수 있다는 것이 마법 전문가들의 견해라고 하였다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007070	However, at the very moment, Solcomm and F'vetta didn't have the time to think it through. All the construction done over the stones were destroyed,{nl}and Schaffenstar members took back what could be used as defensive weapons, and threw out the rest.	하지만 당시의 솔콤이나 프베타로서는 거기까지 생각할 여유가 없었다. 부유석이 움직인 탓에 그간 한 진출로 공사가 쓸모 없게 되었기 때문이었다.{nl}물에 쓸려가지 않고 남은 부분은 샤펜스타 단원들이 탑에서 나와 치우기 시작했다. 투석에 쓸만한 것 등은 탑으로, 나머지는 호수에 던져졌다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6
QUEST_20171128_007071	Some demons were sent to interrupt their operations, but it was too difficult to fight on the lake in the first place. Also, the guards on the tower quickly warned the cleaning crew whenever any demons got close. Half of Schaffenstar shot arrows to keep them at bay, and the other half would run to retreat, taking turns.{nl}The situation was against Solcomm from the beginning, but it didn't stop him from being shunned by demon society.{nl}Although the lower demons wouldn't dare insult him at his face, Solcomm was aware of their discontent.{nl}He couldn't, however, figure out how to regain their trust.	그 작업을 방해하러 부하들을 보내기도 했지만, 기본적으로 호숫물과 접촉하면서 싸우는 일은 큰 부담이었고, 상황을 훤히 보는 탑 위에서 경고를 발하면 작업하던 샤펜스타 단원들은 조를 나눠 활을 쏘면서 한 조가 탑으로 달리는 동안 다른 조가 공격을 하는 방식으로 침착하게 후퇴하곤 했다.{nl}솔콤은 억울한 면이 없지 않았으나 이 패전으로 마족 사회에서 아래위로 다 신망을 잃었다.{nl}하급마족들은 감히 내놓고 말하지 않았지만, 솔콤도 모르지 않았다.{nl}그러나 위신을 회복할 방법이 떠오르지 않았다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록6

After people found out that she was being attacked by the demons, countless men and women took up arms and went to the lake.

QUEST_20171128_007074	Since Solcomm didn't want to fight to the death, he retreated his demons and minions, and went into hiding.{nl}After this incident, it became clear that large-scale sieges like this won't be viable unless the humans' unity was broken and their kingdom fell into chaos.{nl}This surely wasn't going to happen anytime soon, and Solcomm wasn't in a hurry.{nl}Although F'vetta kept trying, assembling demons for attacks was becoming more difficult with each passing day.	솔콤은 이번에는 오래 버틸 생각이었지 끝까지 버틸 생각은 아니었기에 그 정도에서 마물과 마족들을 물린 다음 숨었다.{nl} 따라서 이제부터는 인간사회가 질서를 잃고 왕국이 혼란에 빠지지 않는 한, 대규모 공성전은 더 이상 불가능하다는 점은 명확해졌다.{nl}어차피 그쪽으로는 당장은 가능성이 없다고 생각하기에 당분간 할 생각도 없었다.{nl}프베타가 계속 하고는 있었지만, 마계에서 마족을 끌어오는 일도 점점 어려웠다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록7
QUEST_20171128_007075	Then, Solcomm decided to use humans' one weakness: their mortality.{nl}He decided to simply wait for Lydia Schaffen to grow old and die.{nl}Solcomm was looked down upon by his minions due to this so-called plan, but he was running out of options.{nl}However, he also worked behind the scenes to prevent anyone from becoming Lydia Schaffen's successor or joining Shaffenstar.	 솔콤은 인간이 지니지 않은 마족의 장점을 이용하기로 했다.{nl}리디아 샤펜이 늙어 죽기를 기다리기로 작정한 것이다.{nl}그 사실을 부하들이 어느덧 눈치채고 그를 더욱 한심하게 바라보았지만, 솔콤에겐 다른 대안이 없었다.{nl}그리고 리디아 샤펜의 후계자와 별의 탑 샤펜스타에 신규 단원이 되려는 사람이 없도록 공작을 시도하였다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록7
QUEST_20171128_007076	Sadly, his schemes and tricks were all in vain.{nl}Schaffen's legacies and stories were heard all around the kingdom.{nl}The story of her being in disguise and punishing a tyrannical lord by hitting an apple on the head of a farmer's son,{nl}her forest adventures with Jon Himil (who was curiously considered small, despite his huge size) and their group of righteous outlaws during their days as members of Shaffenstar, the tale of her outsmarting Rumpelstiltskin in a bet, and the legend of her killing the demon king Ghibulinas spread far and wide. After hearing of her exploits, countless people came to Shaffenstar to join them.	그러나 이런 계략은 아무 의미가 없었다.{nl}왕국 어디에 가든 리디아 샤펜이 왕국을 방랑하며 남긴 전설들이 가득했다.{nl}신분을 숨기고 어떤 농민의 아들 머리 위의 사과를 맞춰 포악한 영주를 징계한 이야기,{nl}지금 현재 샤펜 스타에 같이 있는 덩치는 커다랐지만, 작다고 불리는 존 히밀과 어떤 함께 어떤 숲에서 의적으로 활동한 이야기, 럼펠스틸스킨과 내기하여 이긴 일, 마왕 지부리나스를 죽인 사건 등등 리디아 샤펜의 전설적인 영웅담에 끌려 샤펜스타의 단원이 되겠다고 찾아오는 사람은 끊이지 않았다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록7
QUEST_20171128_007077	However, with enough patience, the chance to infiltrate the tower could come. Even if it would take centuries.{nl}Solcomm had the necessary patience, and was aware of humans' nature of forgetting their initial stance over time.{nl}What he didn't know, was that his minions weren't as patient as him.	하지만 몇 백 년이 걸리더라도 인내심을 지니고 별의 탑 내부로 파고들 기회를 찾다 보면 기회가 생길 수도 있었다.{nl}솔콤은 그런 인내심이 있었고, 인간이 세운 제도와 단체는 언젠가는 초대의 유지를 잊기 마련이란 사실도 잘 알고 있었다.{nl}다만 그가 몰랐던 것은 그와는 달리 그의 마족 부하들은 그런 인내심이 많지 않다는 점이었다.				솔콤의 별의 탑 공략기록7
